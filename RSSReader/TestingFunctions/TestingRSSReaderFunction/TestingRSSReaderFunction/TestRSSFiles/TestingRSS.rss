No room is totally silent; you’ve got buzzing lights, squeaky fans, hissing radiators… all of that needs to be edited in. But first, it has to be collected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between gigs I travel to remote locations with my microphone, collecting unique sounds like some foodie chef sourcing exotic ingredients. This particular trip took me to a tiny mountain town in Idaho, where I rented an ancient A-frame smelling like cigarettes and mildew.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After settling in, I hit the trail with my microphone and no real plan. I pressed record, gathering chirping birds, creaking pine trees, and rushing water. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the creek I followed upstream arrived at a waterfall, the rush became a roar. I filled a few minutes of my memory card with the ambience, before exploring further. Behind the waterfall was a half-flooded cave, snaking deep into the rock.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I trudged through water shallower than my knees until the falls faded beyond me, leaving me with the sporadic drip-drop of developing stalactites. My phone flashlight lit the way until this sound faded as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For a moment, I just took it all in: the almost oppressive sound of the mountain vault. Like any space, it still wasn’t totally quiet. There was a deep, almost yawning hum. Unlike usual background noises that felt far off, this was oppressive; like a speaker blasting a base beat’s ghost just inches from my ears. I felt it in my teeth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Weird,” I muttered. My voice banished the sound, filling the cave with its own echo. When the space fell silent, the hum returned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I left unsettled, but ultimately excited for having stumbled upon a fantastic effect for a horror project. After a frustrating few hours in the studio however, I ran into a problem. Any track I added on top of the cave ambience muted it completely. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thinking the problem could’ve been my headphones, I repeated the process over my speakers. The result was the same bone-buzzing hum that set my teeth on edge. Paranoia crept over me, as my brain became increasingly suspicious someone or something was in the room with me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I tried to put the feeling aside for the time being and focus on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Was there a problem with my entire system?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I sent the file to a buddy in the music biz, asking him to test it on his setup. He assured me he would, and I went for a walk to clear my head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He called me an hour later, clearly shaken. “I can’t get rid of it, dude.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Get rid of what?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The noise. I unplugged the board, cut the power—it’s not coming from the speakers. It’s like it’s burned into the background of the room.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Does it go away when you make other noise?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yeah, but it always comes back.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The full scale of the problem didn’t sink in until I returned to my own office to find that oppressive hum waiting for me. This isn’t a bug or software problem; the noise from that cave seems to permanently replace the ambience of whatever room it is played in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;ve discovered an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;invasive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; sound. Aside from the effect it could have on someone who listens for too long, I&amp;#39;m worried about how far it could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coleschapters.com&quot;&gt;spread.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/NobleClimb&quot;&gt; /u/NobleClimb &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2hrpp/im_the_guy_who_does_audio_effects_for_movies_i/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2hrpp/im_the_guy_who_does_audio_effects_for_movies_i/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c2hrpp</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2hrpp/im_the_guy_who_does_audio_effects_for_movies_i/" /><updated>2024-04-12T19:21:19+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-12T19:21:19+00:00</published><title>I’m the guy who does audio effects for movies.

It was my neighbor’s black dog who told me what to do. He is a demon wrapped in fur and skin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His metallic, ringing voice would incessantly scream through my brain every time I tried to fight back. I told him I didn’t want to kill anymore, but he says that he and the other damned spirits need fresh blood to live. He says his name is Friend, and that he only wants what’s best for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t know what kind of dog my neighbor found, but I think it may have come straight from Hell itself. I’ll update this diary soon once I figure out what to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;November 10th, 2023&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I saw the sacrifices in the news tonight. A young man and a young woman. They were young and healthy, beautiful and strong. They had their whole lives ahead of them. I never wanted to do it again, but Friend said we must.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had gone hunting as soon as the Sun set, traveling through the dark, winding streets of the suburbs. On the rolling hills, I found them, the first of the new sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They were parked in a red sedan on a well-known lover’s lane in the area, a spot where the view of the city’s cold, white lights shone like the stars. I had taped a flashlight to the end of my rifle. They seemed to think I was a police officer when I first sent the bright glare of the flashlight streaming through the driver’s side window.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The driver began to roll down the window, his face a mask of confusion as he stared into the white light shining into his eyes. He opened his mouth, his face looking as pale as a corpse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Officer, what is…” he started to say when the voice of Friend screamed through my head like shattering glass.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Take them, now!” Friend gurgled in his flat, dead voice. “We must feed the spirits of the dead with their blood! Do it now. Now. Now!” The voice rose like the wailing of a tornado. I couldn’t breathe or think. My vision turned white as I pressed the trigger again and again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They screamed, but it sounded far-off and faded under the ringing of the gunshots. The man’s face exploded before me in a shower of bone splinters and ground meat. By the time I was done, it looked like nothing more than a crater of gore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bullets smashed through the car with a shattering of glass. The smell of gunsmoke and sweat hung thick in the air. The woman shrieked as one caught her in the throat, then her wailing was cut off. She choked on her own blood, her wide, frantic eyes searching my face, as if for a reason why. But there was no reason, not one that I could tell. They were far from my first, and I doubted they would be the last.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I followed the voice of Friend back home, leaving the dead with their frozen, terrified faces and the panicked animal sweat that clung to their still bodies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;November 11th, 2023&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I haven’t been sleeping much. That dog keeps barking all day and night. His voice rings through my head like an eternal scream. In the barking, I hear the rhythms of something deep and demonic. It gurgles through the night and never leaves me alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When was the last time I slept? Maybe five or six days ago. Everything seems blurry. I know what I need to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At midnight, I heard the incessant barking of Friend, the whispering of dark secrets behind the veil. I grabbed my rifle and slunk out into the night. I needed to end this, right here and now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The street looked as empty as a midnight graveyard. Mist swirled through the blackness in thick, cold clouds that clung to my skin like raindrops. I couldn’t see far as I left my dark and empty house. I peered over the fence separating my property from my neighbor’s. The dog had stopped barking. Now he just looked up at me, his eyes gleaming like cold starlight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What are you going to do with that, Spencer?” Friend asked, his sharp canine teeth glittering through the fog. I saw the dog’s mouth moving, the black lips frozen in a wide, amused smile. “Would you hurt your only friend? Would you kill him, Spencer?” I trembled, feeling drops of sweat break out on my face. Goosebumps rose all over my body as I stared into those dead, empty eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friend looked like a large black dog, reminding me of the Grim from European myths. But anyone who stared at him too long would realize that his teeth seemed far too sharp and numerous, and his eyes always glowed in the night as if with their own inner radiance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I have to do it,” I whispered grimly, staring into the face of Hell. The dog seemed to find this funny. His wide, canine lips rose into a curving grin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Do what you have to do, and I’ll do what I have to do,” he hissed as I pulled the trigger. The dog’s head exploded, spraying black fur and slabs of gore onto the side of my neighbor’s house. I saw Friend’s legs buckle as he stumbled and fell slowly to the ground, still staring up at me with his dead eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;November 12th, 2023&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That night, after I murdered Friend, I finally passed out from exhaustion for a couple hours. The same recurring dream that had plagued me for months on end started as soon as I closed my eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was walking through a dark city street with no one alone. Hundreds of mummified bodies hung from the streetlights, the nooses around their neck fraying with age. They swayed gently in the wind, men, women and children alike, all victims of some terrible atrocity I couldn’t imagine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The echoing of my own footsteps sounded deafening. The entire world felt dead and still. Empty skyscrapers loomed overhead on both sides of me, their giant bodies glistening with glass and steel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Up ahead, something black with long, twisting limbs writhed in the middle of the street like some giant spider. Its skittering legs pushed its gleaming black body high into the air. The countless eyes on its insectile face gleamed with their own inner light, just like the eyes of Friend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Who are you?” I asked, my voice ringing out like a gunshot in the empty silence. The spidery face split into a lipless grin, showing off its curving fangs dripping with venom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You know who I am,” the thing hissed. “I am the true face of Friend. I am the one who will stay with you until the end. Together, we will feed the abyss!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You are the only one saving this world from total destruction. You are a holy one, Spencer, a saint. For you give of yourself to protect all others, even of your innocence and your eternal soul.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For if you did not offer sacrifices to the hungry spirits, then they would spill over the veil like a plague of locusts. You must keep killing. You must offer sacrifices- fresh blood, the bodies of the damned,” Friend whispered. I felt freezing cold here in this empty city where the night sky looked like a blanket of shadows, where we existed without Moon or stars to light the way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I woke suddenly in my bed, the sky outside still black and lifeless, just like in my dream. From my neighbor’s house, I heard the frantic barking of Friend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;November 13th, 2023&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I looked up cases similar to mine on the Internet, wondering if I was going insane. Immediately, the famous case of the “Son of Sam” came up, the man who claimed his neighbor’s dog had forced him to kill. I wondered if it had been Friend, or something like Friend. I kept going over his case, looking for clues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I remembered reading the letter David Berkowitz, called the “Son of Sam”, had sent to the police. His words had seemed bizarre the first time I read them, even insane, but now they had a cold, sickening logic. He had been forced to offer blood, just as I had. I knew that I, too, would ultimately be forced to kill again by the demon next door.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I pulled up his note to the police on the Internet, reading it again and again as I searched for clues. This is what the original note said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I am deeply hurt by your calling me a wemon hater. I am not. But I am a monster. I am ‘The Son of Sam’. I am a little ‘brat’. When father Sam gets drunk he gets mean. He beats his family. Sometimes he ties me up to the back of the house. Other times he locks me in the garage. Sam loves to drink blood. Go out and kill, commands Sam.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Behind our house some rest. Mostly young, raped and slaughtered – their blood drained – just bones now. Papa Sam keeps me locked in the attic, too. I can’t get out but I look out the attic window and watch the world go by. I feel like an outsider. I am on a different wave length than everybody else – programmed to kill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“However to stop me you must kill me. Attention all police: Shoot me first – shoot to kill or else keep out of my way or you will die! Papa Sam is old now. He needs some blood to preserve his youth. He has had too many heart attacks. ‘Ugh me hoot it ‘urts sonny boy.’ I miss my pretty princess most of all. She’s resting in our ladies house but I’ll see her soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I am the ‘monster’ ‘beezlebub’ – the ‘chubby behemouth’. I love to hunt. Prowling the streets looking for fair game. Tasty meat- the wemon of Queens are prettiest of all. I must be the water they drink. I live for the hunt- my life- blood for papa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Mr Borelli, sir, I don’t want to kill anymore. No sir, no more. But I must- Honour thy Father! I want to make love to the world. I love people. I don’t belong on earth. Return me to Yahoos. To the people of Queens, I love you and I want to wish all of you a Happy Easter. May god bless you in this life and in the next and for now I say goodbye and goodnight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Police let me haunt you with these words: I’ll be back! I’ll be back! To be interrogated as bang bang bang bang bang – ugh!! Yours in murder, Mr Monster.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;November 14th, 2023&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s true. I saw it for myself. Friend is back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The gunshots didn’t take. Perhaps he can’t be killed. I just saw the dog, alive and whole. He kept barking as the dying Sun sent its rusty blood spinning across the sky. The night was coming, I knew, and this night would certainly be a long one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The time has come to act, but I’m absolutely terrified. I don’t know what will happen to me. I will keep writing everything down until the end, however. I know what people will think of me. They’ll say I was a liar, a monster, a madman- a murderer. And they might be right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean I can’t try to fight back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the darkness had grown thick and the mist had crept back in like searching fingers, I strapped my pistol onto my hidden holster and headed outside. The dog’s incessant barking rang out in the silent world, harsh and dissonant. I covered my ears, repressing an urge to scream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I slunk past my fence and towards my neighbor’s house where Friend lived. I tried to hide from the dog as best as I could, quickly moving down the sidewalk past the vantage point where he would be able to see me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I did, the barking abruptly cut off. I glanced over, seeing Friend’s luminescent eyes hanging in the dark mist like fireflies. I ripped my gaze away and headed to the front door.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I knocked hard, over and over, until a tired-looking man with a fat face like an English bulldog appeared through the small window. His dark, beady eyes regarded me with suspicion through the glass panes. His entire head looked freshly-shaven; not a single hair marred his scalp or face. His face looked red, his cheeks flushed, as if he had been drinking heavily. After a long moment, he swung the door open, as if in anger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What do you want?” he asked in a gruff voice that sounded like he had been smoking five packs a day since he was twelve. “Who the fuck are you?” I gave him my most charming smile, trying to disarm the fat man, but the suspicion and distrust stayed, engraved deeply into every line of his face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m your neighbor, sir,” I said respectfully. My stomach did flips, and I felt sweaty and nervous coming to this house. “My name’s Spencer. I’m really sorry to bother you, especially when it’s this late…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not late for me,” he answered coldly. “I never sleep anymore.” I nodded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I feel you there,” I said. “Neither do I.” I wondered, at that moment, whether his insomnia and my insomnia had the same underlying cause. He stared at me, his face as blank as a mannequin’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So what is it, Mr. Neighbor?” the man asked sarcastically. The white T-shirt he was wearing was covered in strange food stains. All the colors of the rainbow seemed to be there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s about your dog,” I whispered grimly. The man’s ruddy face instantly seemed to go pale. His mouth opened, but only a strangled, incomprehensible garbling came out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You better come inside,” the man said, opening the door wide and stepping aside. “Spencer, you say? My name’s JJ. JJ Falconer.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JJ brought me into his kitchen. The entire house looked run-down and dirty, filled with rotting garbage bags strewn about. The furniture all had strange water-spots and stains covering them. The smell coming from the house was truly repugnant and foul.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Your dog,” I said as JJ poured two shots of vodka in some suspiciously dirty-looking shot glasses on the table. The rest of the table was covered in filthy dishes, some with moldy food still clinging to their surfaces. “Why does he never stop barking?” JJ pushed a shot glass in my direction, but I shook my head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t drink, sorry.” He gave a bark of laughter at that, his small eyes still watching me intently. And though he laughed, his eyes didn’t laugh- and neither did his mouth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“My dog?” he asked, his voice cracking as some inner turmoil ripped through him. He took the shot in a quick swallow, hissing for a moment as the burning liquid made its way down. Then he poured another one and took that, too. “My dog?! That’s not my fucking dog!” I looked at JJ as if he were insane. Perhaps we both were. I strongly suspected I was after the agonies of the last couple months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“OK…” I answered slowly. “Why does he live behind your house then? Who feeds him? Who gives him water and takes him on walks?” JJ leaned close to me, his eyes glittering with some frantic and dark hidden under the surface.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Nobody. Absolutely nobody. That ‘dog’ just appeared there one night,” he said, his fat cheeks flushing a deep red. “He won’t leave me alone, no matter what I do. I’ve had animal control come and take him away seven times. Seven times! And yet, when I wake up in the morning, that thing is right back there where he started, barking. It’s not any dog. That’s some sort of demon, I think, some punishment from God for all I’ve done wrong. It’s my chain and shackles and my coffin. Yours too, I’m guessing? Why else would you be here?” My teeth chattered as a panicked terror rose in my heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What do you mean?” I asked nervously. “What…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You know exactly what I mean,” JJ said, leaning so close to me that I could smell the stale booze on his fetid breath. “You’ve heard his voice in your head, haven’t you? You’ve seen him in your dreams? His true form, I mean, not the mask he wears to fool the blind.” I stuttered, unable to speak for a long moment. JJ just continued watching me, a sadistic glee evident in his eyes. He enjoyed this, I could tell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yes,” I said finally. “Yes, I have. His name is Friend.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Friend,” JJ repeated, nodding. “Indeed, his name is Friend. He’s no Friend of yours, though. No friend of mine. He’s no friend of anybody’s, except for maybe the Devil.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I tried shooting him last night,” I went on, shaking as I sat in a filthy chair in that dim, musty kitchen. JJ laughed at this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ah, yes, so did I, a few times,” he said. “No luck, I’m guessing?” The dog’s barking started again at that moment, as if it were listening to our conversation. It rang out, echoing through the still shadows outside. I couldn’t see a single person anywhere on the street. It reminded me of my nightmare. A chill like ice water ran down my spine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What if we destroy the body?” I whispered, afraid that Friend might hear me. But that was stupid. He must hear everything, after all, I thought to myself. He is in my mind, and he’s been there for a long time. “You know, like they talk about in medieval times, hunting vampires and demons. They used to use decapitation or they would burn the body until it was nothing but ashes. What if…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Go ahead!” JJ said, giving an apathetic wave of his hand in the direction of Friend. “Go burn his body. I’ve never tried anything like that, but maybe, just maybe, it would work.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You should come, too,” I answered. “This is our burden, both of us. We need to work together. If we don’t stop him, we’ll both surely die or end up in prison forever.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think it’s past that point,” JJ said sullenly, his eyes downcast. “I’m guessing that, if the cops knew what you’ve done, you would already end up in prison forever, am I right?” I pulled back as if physically struck. JJ just grinned. “Yeah, I know that Friend surely made you kill. You don’t think I’ve done the same? If we hadn’t, neither of us would be here. Friend would have slaughtered you like a sheep.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Then that makes it all the more important to stop this now!” I hissed. JJ gave a long sigh. He rose unsteadily to his feet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Fine,” he said, pulling a pistol out of his waist-band. “There’s gasoline in the garage. Let’s fucking do this.” He gave a faint grin as bloodlust radiated from his eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As sickening waves of dread rolled over my body like ripples in a pond, I got up and followed him out of the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JJ held the red canister of gasoline in one hand and the pistol in his other. I, too, had my gun out. He opened the garage door and we walked out into the night, turning to head into his yard- and towards the abomination that wore a dog like a second skin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friend went silent as we approached. His canine lips split into a wide grin. Only the eyes and the sharp, predatory teeth gave any contrast in that black void of a face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JJ didn’t hesitate. He raised the pistol and fired. The shot cracked through the air like thunder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friend’s chest exploded in a flower of bright blood. The canine face didn’t react, however, except that the teeth started chattering, at first slowly and then faster and faster. The eyes seemed to glow brighter as Friend stood up, rising on his back legs to his full height. Rivulets of crimson continued to stream down his chest as he loomed over us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Filled with incomprehensible terror, JJ and I could only watch as Friend’s body began to rip apart. Something black and spidery stabbed its way out through the skin and fur of the dog body, long, skittering legs with many joints that twisted their way to the ground.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The eyes stayed the same, ripping their way out of the skull as a spidery visage appeared from the top of the dog’s mutilated head. Within seconds, the fur, skin and muscles of the dog lay strewn on the lawn like pieces of garbage. I saw the monstrous spider from my nightmare, the true face of Friend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JJ gave a battle-cry and ran forward, shooting over and over, emptying the magazine until his pistol clicked empty. Friend gave a roar that sounded like many alien, insectile voices were screaming together. Friend’s pincers clicked as his many legs carried him forward. His enormous body seemed to dance as they twisted, bringing the alien face down towards JJ’s neck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JJ gave a scream and tried to backpedal, but he was far too slow. With a wet separating of flesh, the pincers came together, slicing off JJ’s head as neatly as a guillotine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The head flew back, landing at my feet. The eyes stared sightlessly up at me, still filled with mortal terror.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Backpedaling away from the demon, I turned and ran. Without looking back, I started down the street, away from my house, away from Friend, away from all these never-ending terrors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I got to the end of the block, I saw police cars zooming down the street. With a squeal of brakes, they stopped in front of my house. They ran out of their cars, lights still flashing, sirens screaming. They had their guns drawn as they kicked down my door and went inside. Apparently, they hadn’t realized that the decapitated body of JJ Falconer also lay a few feet away, just on the other side of the tall wooden fence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You must keep moving,” Friend hissed in my mind, his voice like a scalpel driven into my brain. “We are not done yet. The sacrifices must be offered to the spirits of the damned.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With a silent scream welling in my throat, I ran down the dark road and disappeared.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/CIAHerpes&quot;&gt; /u/CIAHerpes &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2ikt9/please_catch_me_before_i_kill_again/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2ikt9/please_catch_me_before_i_kill_again/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c2ikt9</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2ikt9/please_catch_me_before_i_kill_again/" /><updated>2024-04-12T19:54:51+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-12T19:54:51+00:00</published><title>PLEASE CATCH ME BEFORE I KILL AGAIN</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/LadyAppleFritter</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/LadyAppleFritter</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tug listlessly at my seatbelt. We&amp;#39;ve been driving for ages now. The droning whir of the AC has coated my mind in static agitation; and yet, somehow done nothing to ease the unusual heat of this late May. A flurry of kicks pummels my seat back and I scowl, twisting back to aim a glare at my brother. He plays dumb, laying it on thick to portray the perfect vision of innocence. Beside me, Celia, (Silly), scribbles at her Strawberry Shortcake coloring book with a manic furiosity. She sticks her tongue out with the effort, and I&amp;#39;m on the edge of telling her if she keeps it like that a fly&amp;#39;ll land on it for sure- when we finally pull to a stop, the car rattling like it was on it&amp;#39;s last breath. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Right, this is the last stop for a good while&amp;quot; My father grunts. My mother nods affirmingly. &amp;quot;Silly, don&amp;#39;t you forget to use the facilities, and mind your sister&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Blah blah&amp;quot; I sigh as I clamber out of the suburban, pulling Silly with me by the wrist (Somewhat gently). Silly and I are the designated snack crew, most of our road trips, really. It&amp;#39;s tradition, practically. I stretch, and the warmth outside of the car hits me like a wall. It&amp;#39;s hot and sticky, and makes me realize that the AC has, in fact been useful. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ahead of us is the rest stop, sprawling across the worn parking lot, four buildings in total: A rather shabby gas station, a tiny coffee shop, a fluttering white canopy that housed rows of picnic tables, and beside it a long refurbished barn that appeared to be a restaurant or store of sorts. A faded sign plastered above the entrance announced the name- &amp;#39;Clearview Eat &amp;#39;n Go&amp;#39; in chipped, red, flaking paint. Silly pouts huffily as I drag her across the pavement. &amp;quot;Come on&amp;quot; I chide. &amp;quot;I know you&amp;#39;ve got to be hungry, Sills&amp;quot; &amp;quot;For McDonald&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; She whines. Silly perks up a great deal though, once we&amp;#39;ve stepped through the white painted barn doors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My mood lifts too; the cool air smells like an ice cream shop- which I trace to a mint green counter with a glass front showcasing pastel buckets of ice cream. The whole space is set up a bit like a food court at the mall, separate stalls arranged around the central aisle, advertising fried goods, soda pop, and other delights. Silly beelines for the ice cream counter, nearly bowling over some poor woman with a stroller. I hurry over to apologize for her. &amp;quot;Sorry Ma&amp;#39;am, she&amp;#39;s a wild one, I hope she didn&amp;#39;t wake the baby?&amp;quot; The mother only stared blankly. I peered into the stroller, hoping to find some distinguishing feature to remark on, maybe a compliment to her babys bright eyes or something would smooth things over. I nearly threw up. The thing- the baby, had two enormous empty sockets where it&amp;#39;s eyes should&amp;#39;ve been, where a normal infant&amp;#39;s would have been. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They were dark as pitch, like the skin had been pricked and what shone out was not blood, nor flesh and bone, but the center of a black hole. As I stared quite rudely, for which I was ashamed, it turned those twin tunnels of emptiness on me and I yelped, darting away. Poor thing was probably sick or something, must be. I didn&amp;#39;t want to catch it, that&amp;#39;s all. Poor woman, taking care of that very sick baby. Meanwhile, Silly had been getting up to more fun then I had.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;d just finished rattling off her long list of &amp;#39;Essential&amp;#39; ice cream toppings to the pleasantly cheery middle aged server. I stood behind her awkwardly. Silly thrust a sweaty wad of cash at the server, a grin the size of Texas on her small rounded face, as her cone was handed over the counter. &amp;quot;Thank you!&amp;quot; She squealed. &amp;quot;Now, is this your sister? What&amp;#39;ll you have, young lady?&amp;quot; Her smile seemed outwardly warm; yet it didn&amp;#39;t quite meet her eyes. Suddenly feeling overwhelmed, I just stare at my Mary Jane&amp;#39;s on the concrete floor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The air feels claustrophobic now, the ice cream from in the cooler smells too sweet, other children and adults too loud. I feel like a little girl, lost in the crowd at Disneyland. Whirling around, I scan for the exit. I steered Silly and her ice cream monstrosity to the door, only to find that it.... wasn&amp;#39;t there? &amp;quot;The other end then, I must&amp;#39;ve misremembered?&amp;quot; I muttered, towing Silly in my wake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We sift through the growing crowd, reaching the far side of the barn. Only, when we butt up against it, it&amp;#39;s just solid, white walls, littered with flower festival photos like there hadn&amp;#39;t, only minutes ago, been a door. Except now I wasn&amp;#39;t all that sure it HAD been only minute. Time felt slippery and foreign, like the sour skin on melted ice cream. Panic stabbed at my stomach. I turned to ask Silly if she&amp;#39;s seen a door, maybe on the side walls? But she&amp;#39;s gone, disappeared into the bustling aisle. I spin in a circle, she can&amp;#39;t be far. It&amp;#39;s a small building, it was a small building? Now it seems to extend several football field lengths longer, the other end blurry and far off, as if I was looking through the wrong end of binoculars. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Silly, come out!&amp;quot; I hiss, still searching the crowd. Silly liked to wander; surely she was just beyond that soda fountain, or that stack of red plastic chairs. I was rapidly growing more afraid. Behind the next swell of the crowd, that first pastel wonderland of an ice cream case shone, an oasis. I scurried up to it it, sweaty palms grasping for purchase on the cool marbled countertop. The same woman from before was working it, and she gazed blandly at me as I steadied myself. I turned my bleary eyes to her name tag. It read, in simple block print, &amp;#39;Margaret&amp;#39;. Maybe she&amp;#39;d be able to show me to an exit, or know where my ridiculous, stupid, lost sister had gone. &amp;quot;Ma&amp;#39;am, Margaret, have you seen my sister? The little blonde girl I came in with?&amp;quot; I ask, urgently gesturing an approximation of Silly, sweet Silly&amp;#39;s height. Margaret smiles sickly sweet, adjusting her pink and white striped uniform. I feel like I&amp;#39;ve shrunk, or had the counter grown taller? Margaret leers down at me, displaying a mouth filled with black and rotten teeth. She gives me a leisurely nod. &amp;quot;&amp;#39;Course I&amp;#39;ve seen her. She&amp;#39;ll do&amp;quot; I shiver. This all felt wrong, nightmarish. Margaret&amp;#39;s eyes are cold and unknowable, resembling that sick baby&amp;#39;s. They bore into me, as if daring me to ask. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With a shudder, I comply. &amp;quot;Do for what?!&amp;quot; The woman grins, a jarringly red tongue dancing over her rotten clumps of teeth. She leans in. A rattling, halting hiss drained into honeyed superiority. &amp;quot;Our new and improved strawberry ice cream. It&amp;#39;s packed with protein!&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s then that I notice the dark red swirls crisscrossing one prominently displayed ice cream tub- and the plastic Strawberry Shortcake hair clip. It was partially buried, but Shortcake&amp;#39;s sparkly animation eyes stared up at me from between swirls of thick, syrupy, red. I ran. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m ashamed of it to this day, running away like I did. The shame muddied just how, exactly, I escaped. I remember stumbling into my mother&amp;#39;s arms, sobbing uncontrollably. I remember the scream that tore from her throat. My father&amp;#39;s gutteral wail, my little brothers, all three, staring dazedly out the window, sequestered safely in the car. I remember the shrill sirens, can recall the blue and red lights cast on my face. It had been minutes, they said. The cops said that the Clearview Eat &amp;#39;n Go&amp;#39; was long abandoned, wholey empty. In fact it&amp;#39;d never been approved for zoning, they said. No record. No trace of Silly. My tale was chalked up to a teen&amp;#39;s feverish imaginings in the face of some unthinkable trauma, a kidnapping probably, that was the popular theory. I know that&amp;#39;s not true. Stay safe, and whatever you do-? Don&amp;#39;t go to to Clearview Eat &amp;#39;n Go&amp;#39;. It might eat you. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/LadyAppleFritter&quot;&gt; /u/LadyAppleFritter &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2fytm/clearview_eat_n_go_can_go_to_hell/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2fytm/clearview_eat_n_go_can_go_to_hell/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c2fytm</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2fytm/clearview_eat_n_go_can_go_to_hell/" /><updated>2024-04-12T18:07:16+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-12T18:07:16+00:00</published><title>'Clearview Eat 'n Go' can go to hell</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/TiodoGais</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/TiodoGais</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t believe it worked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those nuts from the silver city were right! Even a broken clock is right twice a day...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, that doesn&amp;#39;t matter, I&amp;#39;m free! Damn, how I missed the fresh air! Although things up here aren&amp;#39;t exactly as I remembered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I still feel a strange weight in my heart; I can sense it, if I died now I&amp;#39;d go straight back to that place. I have to do everything to prevent that from happening, which means clearing the weight from my soul.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not exactly in a situation where I can help others; damn, I can barely help myself. For now I&amp;#39;m living in a homeless shelter while trying to find a job, which is kind of a hard thing to do when you don&amp;#39;t have documents, or a history, or any kind of record. I mean, I did have these things once, but after I died I&amp;#39;m sure my dear wife with all her love and passion threw them in the trash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The library&amp;#39;s wifi sucks, and this computer must be older than the concept of time, but it&amp;#39;ll do, it has to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon this place while searching for experiences similar to mine. I have no idea if half of the accounts here are real, but I hope you believe mine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I escaped from hell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I still vividly remember the centuries I spent there, yes, centuries. Time seems to move differently when you die.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m writing this here in an attempt to do a good deed and stay in the good graces of the man upstairs. Maybe by reading this, you&amp;#39;ll decide to live a good life like monks in Sumeria, or donate all your belongings to the first charity that comes along, you know, become good people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if for some reason you end up in that place anyway, let this serve as a quick guide of what not to do, and if you&amp;#39;re lucky, survive hell and find a way out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m getting strange looks from the lady behind the counter; I better hurry up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I still remember the sensation upon waking up. One moment I was on the operating table, vision blurred, doctor yelling at the anesthesiologist, lights dancing. From what I could gather, the bastard had gone out to have fun a few hours before my surgery, clocked in not so sober and ended up screwing up the dosages, waking me up at the worst moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A domino effect started, resulting in a massive loss of blood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I came to my senses, I was dead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was horrible; I feel claustrophobic just remembering it. It was as if I were trapped in a cast of cement covering my entire body. I couldn&amp;#39;t see, I could barely breathe. A tremendous weight on my heart emerged, as if an anvil had been placed on my chest. I felt immense dizziness and an overwhelming sense of fear and shame.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wanted to scream, cry, anything to get me out of that prison.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Something heard my prayers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was ripped out of my body; that monument of flesh and bones was no longer necessary for me. I stayed still coming to my senses, watching the doctors desperately trying to save me, but it was futile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I felt watched, as if something was evaluating me from all sides. A primal fear rose up my throat as I collapsed into tears.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remembering it now, I think I finally understood; my soul knew exactly what was happening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it could feel where I was going.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I begged, screamed on my knees for one more chance, but how many billions before me had done the same? What reason did they have to listen to me? I felt like I was falling, I saw myself passing through the floor as I struggled to rise. I fell, lower than the deepest pit, lower than the earth, lower than this earthly plane. My hands tremble just remembering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I fell like a shooting star through a dark sky. A foul air filled my lungs as my eyes adjusted to the sight below me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Up here, we have many names for it: hell, abyss, limbo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Down there, they all call it Gehenna, the last city to ever exist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My first day in Gehenna was like those of many who came before me: I fell like a sack of shit into a pit of tar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still in shock from it all I struggled trying to get out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That black goo is always as hot as Satan&amp;#39;s oven, sticking to your skin, and if you don&amp;#39;t get rid of it quickly, it can dissolve you in a matter of minutes. I fought until I was out of strength and sank, agonizing as if drowning in boiling oil, my screams of pain muffled by the pit until my last moments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the second time that day, I died.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imagine my surprise when I woke up again, falling directly into the black lake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t remember how many times I suffered in that loop until I finally managed to escape, naked and with my legs red raw.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Around me, collapsed buildings and filthy houses, uneven ground with sharp and jagged rocks everywhere I went, a black sky through which people fell constantly, and a foul air that weighs heavy and hurt to breathe. I could hear strange grunts, like those of a hyena.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With fear gripping me, I followed my instincts and fled, running aimlessly with bare feet sinking into the ground towards the city. I could hear something following me, several things hunting me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They seemed to be enjoying the exercise. I don&amp;#39;t know what was worse, not knowing where they were or what they looked like.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the distance, I could see what looked like the entrance to a subway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without thinking, I ran, fear propelling my body, which only became heavier with each step. I could hear the panting of several creatures behind me, the flapping of wings and the cacophony of guttural laughter prevented me from looking back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The exhaustion was overwhelming, the pain indescribable. I stayed focused only on the subway; maybe I could lose them down there. With one last effort, I threw myself down the stairs and was embraced by darkness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I crouched behind a bench and covered my mouth,trying to control my breathing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With my eyes fixed on the stairs, I could clearly see the figure of the monster descending them. At first glance, its appearance reminded me of a skinless lion, but it was much larger than the king of the jungle. Its two pairs of eyes resembled those of a reptile ,jaw opened wide displaying two rows of uneven sharp teeth, wings like those of a raven, its four legs proudly displayed huge claws still stained with blood from its last hunt, and its tail was almost as large as its body, coated with a carapace and ending in a sharp point, reminiscent of a scorpion&amp;#39;s stinger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was too scared and tired to do anything other than be quiet and wait, hoping it would miss me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Too tired to realize that with its physique, catching a wounded prey shouldn&amp;#39;t be difficult.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Too tired to notice the dozens of others lurking in the darkness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Too tired to realize that I had been led to its lair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I was massacred by the pack, I realized they were doing everything possible to keep me alive until the last moment, cruelty was ingrained in their nature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I fell once again towards the pitch pit, I finally realized that every piece, every being in this place was made solely to agonize and torture, to cause pain and lamentation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I died for the third time in the same day, I came to understand the true nature of hell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eventually, I managed to escape from the pit and the pack of hunters, fleeing far from the city, away from the buildings, and collapsed at the entrance of a cave.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Guess this is a good stoping point, It&amp;#39;s almost time for my job interview; a former convict chef gave me a chance to work at his burger joint.It&amp;#39;s not the best, but I can&amp;#39;t afford to be picky right now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hell holds many dangers; if you find yourself there upon death, go as far away as possible from the tar pits—it&amp;#39;s the favorite hunting ground of the scavengers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/TiodoGais&quot;&gt; /u/TiodoGais &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c298x2/hell_survival_manual_everything_you_need_to/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c298x2/hell_survival_manual_everything_you_need_to/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c298x2</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c298x2/hell_survival_manual_everything_you_need_to/" /><updated>2024-04-12T13:32:15+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-12T13:32:15+00:00</published><title>Hell Survival Manual - Everything You Need to Survive the 9 Circles!</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/Voodoo_Clerk</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/Voodoo_Clerk</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlocking things that are meant to stay locked has always fascinated me. When I was a kid I would go around the entire house getting my little digits on anything that was behind a closed door. Even at one point getting caught by my parents emptying their sock drawer just because I felt like it. It was annoying to my mom but my dad found it hilarious and by the time I started middle school, my dad bought me my first lock-picking set behind my mom’s back. Our little hobby we could enjoy with each other. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I quickly gained infamy in middle and high school as the girl who could pick any lock that needed unlocking. I got into lockers, locked doors, and cabinets like nothing. And got in trouble plenty of times because of it. It was to the point that I was one more lock away from expulsion in my junior year. So with the threat of my murder at the hands of my mother if I was expelled, I quit lock picking for the rest of my school career. Not cold turkey, of course, I continued to practice at home and outside of school to my heart&amp;#39;s content. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t using this to break into people’s houses to rob them. That wasn’t my style at the time. But I did use it to get into places I wasn’t supposed to. Abandoned houses, off-limit areas, even just those random padlocks on the sides of bridges. Somehow I managed to stay out of trouble and graduate from high school. And it seemed that my life began to go downhill the very moment that diploma was given to me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few months after graduation my dad lost his job. My city was a large industrial zone and it was heavily affected by the recession. The plant that my dad worked at had employed a good chunk of the town. And with its closure, plenty of people were now in danger of losing their homes. My dad was one of those people. Despite everything he tried to keep an outward appearance of calm, but I could tell how badly he was affected by the mounting bills. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, I was unable to find work right out of high school as with the plant’s closure the job opportunities dried up faster than a sponge on a stove. College had never been something I had wanted to do so I had banked on finding a job to maintain myself but with so few opportunities now available to me I decided to do something that until then I had sworn I’d never do. I started using my lock-picking skills to break into abandoned stores and take items to sell to others. If the store wasn’t going to sell them I sure as hell was. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I eventually roped a few of my friends into a little team of robbers to help me. I think I did this mostly to try and justify my choices. Since with other people with me, I could unlock the door and allow them to rob the place. It wasn’t much better, but offered me some dissociation from the crime. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On this day, my three other friends, Jess, Tom, and Jeff, were out late at night and hitting our third and final store. Kneeling before the door I was in the zone as I tried to get the tumblers to cooperate with me. But something about this lock differed from the thousands of others I had opened before. Every bit of progress I made was just as quickly undone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Mace, hurry up man. Someone is going to see us!” Jess said in her usual tone of apprehension whenever we did this. Mace was my preferred nickname since saying Macedonia out loud was certainly a mouthful to most people. I quickly waved her away as I suddenly started making more progress. My eyes grew wide as I felt the lock ready to give. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What even was this store?” I asked no one in particular, far too focused on the progress I was making on the strange lock. Jess wasn’t much help as she continued looking up and down the street to see if anyone would notice us. Even though this entire section of town was completely abandoned by businesses and especially by cops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A voodoo shop,” Tom said as he tried to peer into the windows of the shop to try and see if anything could be seen. But on top of the fact that the sun was setting, the windows of the shop were completely caked in dust from the inside making it completely impossible to figure out what was inside the store. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“By the look of things this shit hole was abandoned even before everything went tits up.” Jeff sighed as he blew a cloud of smoke from his mouth. Along with Jess, he was serving as a lookout, though at that moment he was more concerned with finishing his cigarette. “My grandma told me about this place, and that it was cursed or whatever.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The fact it&amp;#39;s a voodoo shop probably aids in that assumption,” Tom said as he pulled his face away from the window and looked over at me. I had my tongue out as I fished around for the final tumbler. And finally, with one last satisfying click, I quickly grabbed the door handle and yanked it down. The old wooden door opened and a small rusty bell jingled our arrival to the empty shop. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Alright kids, do your thing,” I told my friends as I pulled my hook tool out of the keyhole and stood aside for them to enter the shop. Robbing wasn’t my style, I got my thrill from unlocking the doors not from stealing shit. Jeff and Tom were quick to enter the store but Jess hesitated at the entrance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ve got a really bad feeling about this Mace,” she told me as I carefully packaged my tools and placed them into my jacket pocket. Jess was always the scardey cat in our group and acted sort of like our moral compass. Honestly, if things weren’t so bad in the city then she wouldn’t be doing something like this at all. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s gonna be okay, Jess. Just quick in and out like always.” I smiled and patted her on the back. That didn’t do much to reassure her but it was enough to get her to enter the store. I leaned against the store wall and acted as the new lookout. If all went well we could usually clear out an area as quickly as 15 minutes. Sure that wasn’t exactly enough time to get most of the valuables but it was enough time to get a decent enough haul.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I looked down at my wristwatch and watched the second hand tick away. It was eerily quiet and it started getting on my nerves the longer it went on. There wasn’t even any wind, not even a small distant break of glass. It was dead silent and I suddenly started feeling like how Jess usually did. I stared back down at my watch and I felt vomit build up in my throat. Somehow in that short moment of panic, an entire half hour had passed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Shit,” I mumbled out as I looked back at the store. Not a sound came from inside, not any talking or even the sound of things getting moved around. It was like I was in a bubble of silence that let no sound whatsoever through. I stared at the entrance to the store and hoped that suddenly they would come bursting out of the store with the things they’d stolen. I started panicking the longer that it was taking them to exit. Finally, after a few more minutes I reached out and opened the door to the shop, the sad rusty bell jingled and announced my arrival. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The inside of the shop was completely covered in dust and cobwebs. Jeff had been right in thinking that this place had been abandoned much longer than the other buildings we’d broken into. And yet the entire store was completely stocked with items for sale. Potions and charms lined the shelves and by the cash register, there was an entire wall of voodoo dolls. Each of them was different and wearing clothes with black button eyes that seemed to follow me the more I walked around the store. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Guys?” I called out, wondering where the hell they even were. That eerie silence continued to follow me and it was as if I could hear every single squeak of the floorboards and every breath I let out. There wasn’t a single sign of my friends at all. I was about to leave and try to call them but suddenly the ring of a bell pulled my attention over to the register. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There, standing behind the register was Jess. But she looked off, very off. She had a giant smile on her face and her eyes were almost as large as her smile was. She slowly turned her head to look at me in a very janky way. Her eyes moved in a couple of directions before they focused on me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We shouldn’t have come here, Macedonia,” she told me in a chipper voice that instantly put me in a fight or flight mode. In the five years I’d known Jess she’d never once called me by my full name. And it immediately creeped me out. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Jess, what’s wrong with you?” I asked her as I started backing up towards the entrance to the store. Her eyes followed me as she stayed still at the register. “Where are Tom and Jeff?” I asked her she tilted her head at me and slowly narrowed her eyes at me, the smile never leaving her face. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They’re dead,” she said with a laugh I’d never heard her make. My heart started beating so fast that it felt like it was going to burst right out of my chest and I quickly turned around to leave. Running to the door and grabbing the lever, I was shocked to discover that somehow it had locked itself from the other side. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What the fuck is going on?!” I screamed, pounding my fists on the door before turning back around to look at Jess staring at me at the counter, her laughs turning into cackles as I noticed that something was sticking out of her back and forcing her to sway side to side as she laughed. Noticing that my eyes were focused on the foreign object sticking out of her back, the smile on her face somehow grew wider. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think she noticed, sir,” she said through her cackles. I watched as her eyes rolled up inside of her head and someone began to stand up from underneath the register. The person was giant and gaunt, with a freshly pressed and clean suit that somehow fit him perfectly despite his frail appearance. His black hair was a mess of curls and knots, a stitched-up mouth curled up into a horrible smile, and his skin was whiter than chalk was, with buttons for eyes and more stitches that appeared to be keeping his head attached to his shoulders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Shame on you, for not introducing us, Jessica,” he said with a hoarse Southern accent. With his other arm, he reached below the register again and produced a top hat to complete his ridiculously horrifying look. Jess’s eyes suddenly rolled back down and her head quickly jerked to look at the monster that was nonchalantly having an arm on her back. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But you already know who she is, sir!” She giggled at him before her eyes again rolled back into her head and he pulled his arm out of her back with a sick wet pop. Jess suddenly went limp and slammed her face into the counter, revealing that her entire backside had been ripped open and everything scooped out of her. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“My, my, Miss Macedonia! Ain’t your daddy ever teach you not to break into stores?” the monster said with a yellow toothy grin so giant he was about to rip the stitches right off of his face. I frantically looked around the store for anything to defend myself with as my eyes again settled on the lifeless body of Jess left on the register. I could only imagine what this sick fuck had done with Jeff and Tom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Who the fuck, are you?” I demanded to know from him, reaching into my pocket and trying to find anything that might protect me. But in the brief second that I looked down when I pulled out my mini pocket knife he had somehow appeared before me sending me into a screaming fit. He stood there for a moment as I began to cry and damn near piss myself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Y’all are breaking into my store and don’t even have the common courtesy to read the sign?” He tsked in disappointment and pointed a blood-stained glove above my head. I thought he was about to finish me off right then and there, but instead, he was pointing above me. I spared a glance and looked at the wooden sign hung up over the door. ‘Ol’ King Creole’s Half Priced Voodoo Store’. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“King Creole?” I whimpered as I looked back at his pale face. He nodded and took off his hat doing a dramatic bow before me. “P-please sir, w-we thought this place was-” He quickly held up a finger to my face and softly shushed me. Standing straight again he slowly brought his finger to his mouth to continue shushing me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Your friends already gave me the same spiel. That don’t automatically make you in the right I’m afraid,” he said with a chuckle as he switched from shushing me to tapping his long fingers against his face in thought. “Now what am I going to do with you?” He was practically giddy with excitement over what he was going to do to me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“P-please, I-I’ll do anything just please don’t hurt me!” I screamed at him, feebly holding the knife in front of me. Something about what I said pulled him out of his giddy imagination. But the smile remained on his face as he suddenly grabbed me by the shoulders and shoved his entire face into mine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Aaaaaanything?” He hissed with excitement. I half expected his breath to be horrendous but oddly enough, it didn’t smell like anything at all. That along with his sudden interest in me quickly got me to nod in agreement. “Wonderful! Then how about this, Macedonia my dear.” He let go of me and quickly ordered me to follow him as he practically skipped his way past the register. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“M-Mace,” I mumbled at him but he was already too far away to have heard me. I sheepishly followed after him as I wiped my face of tears and boogers and placed the pocket knife back in its home. I quickly ran past Jess’s dead body and just did my best to avoid eye contact with anything, following after King Creole as he took me into the back room and into his office. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In exchange for your life, Mace.” That caught me off guard since he somehow had heard my nickname. “You’ll do five jobs for me. Should be simple with a woman of your skills of lockpicking. In exchange for that, I shall promise that nothing will happen to you,” he said with a smile and he looked around his desk for something. It seemed too good to be true, and there was definitely going to be something attached to this but at the same time, I couldn’t really argue with him. If anything these jobs would ensure that I kept on living at least a little longer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What kind of jobs?” I asked him after some hesitation. He quickly spun around on his heels and produced a drawing for me. I looked down at it and was greeted by a flannel-wearing voodoo doll with a beard and a little axe to go with. “What am I supposed to do?” I asked him with some confusion. He chuckled and sat in his chair staring at me with his button eyes and creeping me out to no end. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Break into that address and bring back that doll to me. Seems one of my store clerks sold him without telling me. And I’d rather have him back here safely in the store than out and about.” I was about to ask what address but it suddenly began to appear on the paper in front of me above the doll. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s one job.” He held up a finger to me and wagged it back and forth. “Complete this job and then I’ll contact you for another one at a later date. Understand?” he asked with a smile. I stared at the paper and tried to work out the address in my head. It was local and was maybe a half-hour walk from our current location. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Okay,” I told him, folding the drawing and stuffing it into my pocket. I stood there awkwardly before I started turning around to go and do the job. Before he grabbed my shoulder from behind and draped a necklace out in front of my face. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Almost forgot. You might need this.” He chuckled as I held my hand out for the necklace and he dropped it into my hand. It was a simple rope necklace with a strange talisman attached to it. “If that lil’ fellow is causing you issues, just show him that. Should clear everything up.” He patted my shoulder and finally let me out of his office. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I could feel his gaze on me as I slowly and shakily made my way back out onto the shop floor and made my way to the door. Even when I was sure we had broken the line of sight it felt like he was still staring deep into my soul. As I reached out to open the door it opened for me and I quickly exited the shop. Despite that, it still felt as if he was watching me from somewhere. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I panted softly as my knees gave out and I collapsed to the sidewalk and threw up into the street. As I wiped the bile from my mouth, I stared down at my watch and felt another drop kick to my stomach. According to my watch that entire ordeal had lasted only a full minute. Terrified by the power that King Creole possessed, I quickly got up from the floor and went about heading towards my destination. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The walk there was uneventful but if you had seen me walking down the sidewalk you would’ve thought that I was paranoid, which I most certainly fucking was. At every noise that was made near me, I looked back expecting to see that tall bastard following after me. Every five steps I felt the need to look behind me or next to me or even fucking above me in the sky. My heart had calmed down a bit but it was now again pounding as I neared my destination. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was one of the last nice suburbs left in the city, and the address pointed to it being a house in the neighborhood. I wasn’t exactly new to breaking into houses but this would be the first time that I would ever break into one that wasn’t abandoned or condemned. The sense of paranoia that King Creole was following me suddenly turned into paranoia of someone from one of the other houses seeing me breaking in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I arrived at the house to find it completely dark. I swallowed a rising lump of bile and anxiety in my throat and dug into my pocket. Taking out the note I double-checked to be sure that this was the place and then pulled out my tools. I was fortunate enough that the family living here had several plants on their porch which served to keep me hidden from view. If you were to look at me and know I was there it was obvious, but a passing person wouldn’t be able to see me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My hands trembled uncontrollably as I attempted to pick the lock to the home. It was a simple lock and yet my hand just wouldn’t cooperate with me. I had the necklace that King Creole gave me tied up in my hand like it was some crucifix and I was about to go fight some vampires, and this strange talisman thing was shaking around as my hands tried to do the thing that I had done countless times before. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Common, just, fucking.” I was getting pissed at myself for not only not being able to pick a lock, but also for getting myself into this whole situation. But soon the rhythm began to return to my movements as I fished with my hook tool and was finally able to get the tumblers to cooperate and open the door for me. I let out a relieved sigh and quickly entered the house. I was glad to see that this family didn’t have an alarm system and this would hopefully be a quick job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The house was dark and illuminated only by the setting sun. But I was still too scared to turn the lights on so I made do with the limited amount of sun that I had to work with. I quickly made my way into the living room and frantically began searching for the voodoo doll. It was when I was looking under the couch for it that I heard a rhythmic slapping sound. Like someone hitting a wet mop against a hard surface. At first, I thought it was someone coming down the stairs but after a few seconds, it continued. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I tried to ignore it and continue my search for the doll. But it was soon obvious that it wasn’t in the living room. I looked over at the family pictures and saw that they had a kid. Which made me even more ashamed of what I was doing. But it also showed me that the doll was mostly likely upstairs in their son’s room. As I made my way over to the staircase, that sound grew louder and louder. On instinct, I pulled out my knife again and started slowly making my way up the staircase. As I did so the sound grew louder but was also coupled with a cracking sound. As I made it to the top of the stairs the carpet on the stairs suddenly became very soggy. In the dim light, I thought that maybe their bathtub had flooded. But as I leaned down to touch the carpet I was horrified to see that it wasn’t water. It was blood. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The puddle of blood was coming from the room just to the left of the stairs and against my better judgment I took a peek inside. I was horrified to see a man in a flannel swinging an axe down over two horribly mangled corpses. That’s where that sound had been coming from. I was able to put two and two together to realize that this guy had been the voodoo doll. But I had no idea how I was going to get him back to King Creole, but that wasn’t going to matter if I was about to end up like the family here. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I started back down the stairs but I hadn’t noticed how far the blood had traveled, and my first step resulted in my falling down the stairs and landing flat on my ass. I sat there stinging in pain all over before I was suddenly horribly reminded about what I had just seen. I quickly looked back up the stairs and had to cover my mouth before I screamed. The axeman was staring down at me with a crazed look on his face and smacking the blunt part of his axe against his palm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“First day of freedom and I already get to kill someone else.” His husky voice chuckled as he started walking down the stairs towards me. He cackled as he slapped the axe against his palm with each step he took toward me. I quickly looked around for anything that could help me and suddenly remembered the necklace. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“S-stay back!” I screamed out as I held up my hand with the talisman wrapped around my hand. He reached the end of the stairs and kept coming toward me as I frantically backed up. I held it up toward him and prayed that it would do something. He lifted the axe over his head and was about to bring it down on me when a sudden flash of bright light enveloped the two of us. The axe fell right between my legs and got me to scream out in fear. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as I blinked away the last of the blinding light’s effects I saw that the axeman had disappeared. Replaced with the voodoo doll of him. I sat there for a few seconds before I let out a few pained laughs. As I picked up the doll from the floor I suddenly started hearing crying coming from upstairs. I looked up and saw the son staring down at me and crying. It was certainly some consolation that he hadn’t been killed but now there was the issue that he had seen me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“H-hey sweetie,” I told him. He must’ve been no older than seven or eight. “I-it’s okay, I took care of the bad man. You just call 911 okay? Can you do that for me?” I asked him. He sniffled and quickly nodded before walking over to another room, which I assumed was one with a phone. I quickly stuffed the voodoo doll into my pocket and left the house as quickly as I could. Not even bothering to lock the door since the cops would most likely be not too far behind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I returned to the voodoo shop Creole was simply ecstatic to see me. And when I produced the voodoo doll I thought he was going to die from happiness. I watched as he took the doll from me and pinned it back to the wall of voodoo dolls. There were so many of them and I got the sudden and horrible realization that they were all people turned into dolls. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You did a wonderful job, Mace!” he told me with a hard slap to the back, that’s one down and four to go,” he said with a happy chuckle. I felt my knees wobble at the thought of what he was possibly going to make me do now. It wasn’t like I would be able to tell him no. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to end up like my friends, or like the people turned into voodoo dolls on his wall. Or even worse if I were to tell him no. So for the time being, I’m in his debt until I can pay it off. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fuck my life. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Voodoo_Clerk&quot;&gt; /u/Voodoo_Clerk &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2iu3v/im_indebted_to_a_voodoo_shop_part_1/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2iu3v/im_indebted_to_a_voodoo_shop_part_1/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c2iu3v</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2iu3v/im_indebted_to_a_voodoo_shop_part_1/" /><updated>2024-04-12T20:05:24+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-12T20:05:24+00:00</published><title>I'm Indebted to a Voodoo Shop (Part 1)</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/CheckUrCrawlspaces</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/CheckUrCrawlspaces</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;My grandparents bought their cabin in the spring of 1965. For the sake of privacy, I am going to be extremely vague while describing the property, but it is somewhere in the Rockies on a small and relatively undeveloped lake. There&amp;#39;s a smattering of cottages and cabins around the water, but it is mostly pristine and absolutely gorgeous. They were completely smitten and bought it after visiting once.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cabin itself was relatively small and quaint but incredibly cozy with a stunning view of the lake. A single grand room with the kitchen in the left corner, on the right side were two bedrooms with a small bathroom in-between. A ladder in the corner led up to the tiny loft area where the kids always slept. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That first summer there was absolutely phenomenal, according to my grandmother. She was in love with the view of the lake and the handsome mountains in the distance. They were up almost every weekend, hosting parties and barbeques, indulging in a summer of swimming and bonfires and running the woods. She did admit there was one spot in the corner of their 10 acres that she never did like.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She stumbled upon it in the first two weeks while out exploring the property. It was in a small clearing in a sort of gully between two large hills at the back corner of the property, where their acreage butted against a state park. A feeling of dread washed over her as she crested the hill and looked down and saw a smear of gray in the clearing below. She felt her hackles rise and became acutely aware of a feeling like she was being watched. Carefully making her way down the hill, the feeling only intensified.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It felt dead. Everything was a little dimmer there, the forest sounds were hushed and the air felt heavy. The smear turned out to be an area, roughly a circle, about fifteen feet across. Any seeds which found it their fate to grow there grew small and twisted, failing to thrive. Even the squirrels and birds seemed to avoid it. Feeling something was very off, she hurried back up the hill. Worried it was a bear or mountain lion that made her feel so ill at ease there, she encouraged the children to avoid that area and always avoided it herself when she could. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She reassured herself by reasoning it was a geothermal phenomenon and put it firmly out of her mind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eventually summer gave way to autumn and my grandparents began preparing for a long winter of skiing and ice fishing. They chopped and prepared firewood for the wood burning stove in the main room, carefully stacking it in a small lean-to on the side of the cabin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was early November and there was finally enough snow for them to embark on the first ski weekend of the season and they were thrilled to be so close to several different ski resorts. My grandparents left the kids at home and went with their longtime friends, Bea and Al.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The couples arrived shortly before dark on Friday evening and settled in for a weekend of fun. They had dinner and drinks and sat around the table chain smoking cigarettes while playing cards. As my grandmother tells it, they went to sleep sometime around 10:30 as they wanted to be up with the sun and be ready to hit the slopes by the time the runs opened. They bid their goodnights and tucked into their beds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was at about midnight that everyone was awakened by a ruckus being made at the front door.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fierce pounding, rattled the door on its hinges. Everybody convened in the living room to see what was going on, groggy and confused. They were in a very rural area, the driveway was over a half mile long and ran off of a rarely traveled dirt road. It was well below freezing outside and snowing, so a visitor of any sort seemed unlikely. My grandmother voiced what her mind went to thinking; it was a bear. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They stood in a sort of shocked silence as they watched the door jiggle from the force of whatever was on the other side. Suddenly, the banging stopped and a woman&amp;#39;s voice called out to them, &amp;quot;please! Let me inside! Please! It&amp;#39;s so cold out and I have my baby with me!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Al stepped forward towards the door, reaching for the latch, but something about the tone, something about the entire situation had my grandma feeling suspicious. Something wasn&amp;#39;t right and she couldn&amp;#39;t put her finger on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t!&amp;quot; My grandma whispered fiercely to Al before he unlocked the door, he paused with his hand in midair, &amp;quot;something about this isn&amp;#39;t right, I don&amp;#39;t know what, but I really don&amp;#39;t think we should open the door.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The room broke into whispered arguments, Al thought it was ridiculous to ignore a woman and child in need, Bea was backing him up, even Grandpa felt unsure about it, but he trusted his wife. She had been right about a lot of little things before, like the time she insisted on turning around and going home when they had not left fifteen minutes before because she had a feeling. They came home to a smoldering fire behind the refrigerator that surely would have burnt their house down if they hadn&amp;#39;t caught it when they had.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His guts twisted at the thought of whoever was on the other side of that door being as devastating as a house fire to trigger this reaction in his wife who normally wouldn&amp;#39;t hesitate to give a stranger the shirt off her back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their bickering was interrupted by the door banging, and again, a woman&amp;#39;s voice pleading at them through the thick wood planks, &amp;quot;please! Let me inside! Please! It&amp;#39;s so cold out and I have my baby with me!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They all listened to this mystery woman as she repeated verbatim what she had said a minute ago, but now they were more aware of a flatness to her voice. An almost mechanical sort of rote quality to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone stood very still and quiet, making eye contact that showed they understood now what had triggered my grandma&amp;#39;s suspicion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Please! Let me inside! Please! It&amp;#39;s so cold out and I have my baby with me!&amp;quot; the woman said in the same off tone, &amp;quot;wahhhh, wahhhh, wah-ahhh,&amp;quot; she began imitating a baby cry, pitching her voice up, but still the same bizarre monotony to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My grandma said she got an icy feeling in her gut and her face got hot as her heart began pumping adrenaline. Something was seriously wrong with whoever was outside. Everyone was frozen in place, eyes locked on the door; four Grecian statues in flannel pajamas and slippers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whoever it was began scratching on the door like an animal, &amp;quot;Please let me in! I know you&amp;#39;re in there, I can hear you all!&amp;quot; Her voice sounded like it was getting frantic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The banging began again and she began screaming, &amp;quot;LET ME IN! LET ME IN! LET ME IN!&amp;quot; over and over again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It took several minutes but eventually the banging stopped and she quieted down. Grandpa George suggested they all head back to bed and look around outside when it was light. They hesitantly shuffled back to beds, feeling a lot less cozy and comfortable than they had in the same position just fifteen minutes ago, they prepared for a night of restless sleep and tried to drift off. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The banging continued intermittently for the next few hours, but seemed to finally come to a stop. My grandparents fell asleep and woke around 7:30 when the sun was beginning to rise. They opened their bedroom door and walked into the main room and my grandma felt her stomach drop when she saw the door wasn&amp;#39;t locked anymore. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She felt furious with Bea and Al because one of them had obviously unlocked the door, she couldn&amp;#39;t believe the foolhardiness. She rapped on their bedroom door and swung it open before they even could respond, but only Bea was in the bed. She woke up shocked and obviously groggy, Bea had no idea what was going on. Putting on her robe, Bea came out into the main room with them, &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s going on?&amp;quot; she asked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did you or Al unlock the door last night?&amp;quot; My grandma asked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bea looked uncomfortable and stared down at her feet. She explained that Al hadn&amp;#39;t been able to handle the banging, even if something was off with the woman, she still deserved their help. He had thought my grandmother was being unnecessarily cruel to deny someone shelter in the cold and snow. Bea had begged him not to, but he got dressed and snuck out into the main room and had gone outside to help. Bea had tried to stay up and wait for him, but she eventually fell asleep until just now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They checked the bathroom and the loft space, but Al was definitely not in the cabin. Maybe he had gone to the main road to help her with a car repair? Or helped lead her along the lake trail to another cabin with more accommodating occupants?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They quickly dressed and opened the door and they all stood in a distinctly distressed silence as they only saw a single set of footprints heading away from the cabin into the woods. There was no sign of a woman&amp;#39;s footprints whatsoever, just Al&amp;#39;s large boot prints disappearing into the treeline. My grandpa grabbed his shotgun and he and my grandma headed out to follow the tracks to try and find Al, leaving Bea behind in case Al came back of his own accord.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was difficult terrain to navigate in the snow, some areas they had to wade through waist high drifts and struggled up snowy hills and down icy rocks. They had no idea how or why Al had done this on his own in the pitch dark and were honestly expecting to find him with his neck broken at the bottom of every hill they summited.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfamiliar with the stark winter appearance of her happy woods, it took my grandma a moment to realize they were heading closer and closer to the dead zone. Sure enough, they followed his footsteps to the top of a hill and they could see down into the gulley the clearing where nothing grew. Even in winter, it was still drab and gray, the snow seemed to melt from that area and gently steamed, reassuring my grandmother of its geothermal properties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Far less reassuring was that they could see Al&amp;#39;s footsteps leading up to the dead spot, but no Al and no more footsteps anywhere else in the gully. It was like he vanished.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They made their way down the hill and canvassed the area, they saw no sign of him. They looked all over, calling for him for over half an hour before they decided they needed to head to town and get the police involved. It took almost an hour for them to make it back and Bea was frantic with worry when she saw them come back without him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A day that was supposed to be filled with skiing and Hot Toddies by the lodge fireplace had turned into a nightmarish blur of police interviews, organizing search parties, and canvassing every square inch of the property and surrounding park trying to find any sign of Al or the supposed woman who had been banging on the door.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the time it got dark, my grandparents were exhausted. Bea got taken into town by the police because she didn&amp;#39;t want to stay at the cabin. Honestly, neither did they, but they were too exhausted to make the drive to a hotel and they wanted someone to be there in case Al miraculously reappeared. They slept with the shotgun by the bed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Banging on the door woke them up at about midnight. Their hearts felt a few moments of elation believing it might be Al, when instead they heard, &amp;quot;Please! Let me inside! Please! It&amp;#39;s so cold out and I have my baby with me!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spirits brought back down to Earth, they held each other and listened, as sporadically through the night, whatever it was, tried to plead its way through the door before it apparently gave up and they were finally able to sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next day went very much the same, scrambling over snowy acres with a search party looking for any trace of their friend and finding nothing. My grandparents had to go back home and they left begrudgingly, feeling like they&amp;#39;d failed their friend by not being able to find him, for taking him up there, for not hearing him leave and stopping him; layers of guilt anyone involved with a beloved friend&amp;#39;s disappearance would naturally feel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a few days, the search party was called off as it was presumed Al was dead by this point and the terrain was rugged and dangerous for the crew. My grandparents went sporadically through the winter to continue searching their property and the state park. They never heard from him again, but they did hear from the woman at the door. It only took a few trips that winter for them to give up on finding Al and to be too scared of that flat demanding voice coming from the outside. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They seriously discussed selling the place, seeing as it would be permanently blighted by Al&amp;#39;s disappearance and the crippling fear they felt whenever they heard that imitated baby cry through the door. My grandma was hesitant, though, she really had fallen in love with this land and the cabin. Looking at the mountains over the lake made her feel like her heart was soaring through the clouds, it was such an intense and pure beauty that it made her heart ache in a deliciously wistful way. She felt like she would regret passing this place on to other people, both for what she would lose, but also what she would be exposing an innocent new buyer to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t return until spring when all the snow had melted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first night back up there, my grandma lay awake anxiously awaiting the banging to start around midnight, but it never came. Nor did it come the next night. They came back up for a few more weekends, but they didn&amp;#39;t hear from the lady at the door. After that, the anxiety faded away and a sense of security was restored. They all slept peacefully in their beds after days galavanting about the lake and through the woods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eventually the snow fell and they went up for another attempt at a ski trip, but the first night there with snow on the ground, the thing came back and began going through the exact same motions. They winterized the cabin the next day and didn&amp;#39;t come back until spring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, that became the tradition. The family was never made privy to the tragic disappearance of Al, he became a hidden chapter of my grandparent&amp;#39;s lives. They didn&amp;#39;t tell their kids for fear of scaring them. Us grandkids didn&amp;#39;t really question growing up why we never went in the winter. My grandma just told me it was too cold and drafty up there and that it was far more pleasant and cozy at the ski lodge when we wanted to indulge in winter sports. That worked until I got into college in the early two thousands and word got out in my friend group about my family cabin on the lake. I was able to avoid anyone asking to use it until my friend Cody got it into his head to convince me to sneak up one December to use it as a base camp for a weekend of skiing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No one will know, he said. We can invite girls, he implored. It&amp;#39;s sitting empty, he whined. I was nineteen at the time and knew nothing about Al&amp;#39;s tragic disappearance or any spooky door banging at the cabin during winter, so regrettably, I caved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plan was for Cody and I to go up Thursday night and get things set up at the cabin and shovel. We were going to skip classes Friday and snowboard until it was time for the girls to get up in the evening, where we would greet them and officially start the weekend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We got there and I was awed by the stark beauty of the terrain in winter. I&amp;#39;d never seen the lake frozen, how serene it was in the cold sunlight. The cabin looked quaint and cozy with the snow piled around it. We both pointed and laughed in delight at a woodpecker fluttering from tree to tree around the cabin, banging away at the dead trees in the afternoon sunlight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We set to work and started shoveling off pathways and started a fire inside to warm it up. Something I hadn&amp;#39;t considered was the pump to the well being shut off for the winter, so we would have to use the old outhouse. I hoped the girls wouldn&amp;#39;t mind, but using a cold outhouse would quickly fall to the bottom of my concerns after night fell and I found out why we don&amp;#39;t use the cabin in the winter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cody and I were still up at midnight, drinking beers and playing cards, when we both flew out of our seats as the door started banging so hard I could hear the jamb creak against the pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chests heaving, we both stared at the door in shock. Neither of us had heard a car or any footsteps outside. It was so quiet out, you could easily hear a car driving on the main road a half mile away, let alone someone’s footsteps crunching in the snow outside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We heard a woman on the other side of the door, crying and yelling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Please! Let me inside! Please! It&amp;#39;s so cold out and I have my baby with me!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Something about the way she said it sounded too weird to me, I felt goosebumps shoot down my arms. Cody made like he was heading towards the door to open it and before I could even think about it, I made a quick “tsk” noise to make him look at me and vigorously shook my head for him to not move towards the door.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He vigorously nodded his head back at me and jerked his shoulders up and motioned to the door with both arms and an exasperated face, like, “come on man, it’s some chick with a baby!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I couldn’t shake it though, I couldn’t believe neither of us hadn’t heard a thing as she came up to the door; no cars, no snow, no boots on the porch…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We were interrupted by more banging on the door as whoever was on the other side proceeded to plead their case, “Please! Let me inside! Please! It&amp;#39;s so cold out and I have my baby with me!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We cannot open the door, I have a really bad feeling about this,” it would have been obvious to anyone outside there were people in the cabin, but I instinctively wanted to stay quiet and had leaned in to whisper to Cody, “I don&amp;#39;t know if this is a trap for a robbery or what, but let&amp;#39;s just go to bed, man.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The banging continued and I think the bizarre nature of this whole exchange sunk in for Cody a bit and he nodded his head in agreement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We tiptoed to our beds and tried to fall asleep with the weird commotion on the front porch. I had just drifted off when I thought I heard the door latch shut. I wrote it off and thought Cody must have been using the bathroom, but I never heard him go back to his bedroom. Suddenly feeling suspicious and more awake, I got up and checked, the front door was no longer locked and Cody was nowhere in the cabin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I opened the door and with the porch light, I could just see what I thought was a man sized figure disappear into the treeline across the yard. Wondering what the fuck Cody was thinking, I quickly threw on some jeans and boots, grabbing my coat, hat, and a flashlight as I ran out the door to go after him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It had begun snowing, which obscured what I could see, but I noted there was only one pair of boot prints heading out the door and through the yard that I began following into the woods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was very rugged terrain and quite difficult to follow his path. I couldn&amp;#39;t fathom what he was doing out here by himself. I tried to move along as quickly as possible, he had only a few minutes&amp;#39; lead on me, but I couldn&amp;#39;t even see him through the falling snow and thick trees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eventually, I crested a hill and finally saw Cody standing down at the bottom. What I was seeing didn&amp;#39;t make sense to me, though. It looked like he was wearing a cloak of some sort, it obscured his head like a hood and draped down his whole body, and he was standing in front of a circle of black in the ground where the snow didn&amp;#39;t accumulate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As my brain struggled to figure out what was draped over him, the ground shuddered and a gaping hole in the black earth opened up right in front of Cody. Adrenaline kicked in and I half slid and half ran down the hill, trying to get to him and pull him back. When I got up to him and shined the flashlight on him, I realized the “cloak” was pink and slimy looking. The inside of the sinkhole that had just opened in front of us looked similarly pink and slimy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A reek of death and rot filled the air in the gulley. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Confused, I reached for his shoulder with my free hand, touching the cloak, and swung Cody around to face me. The texture of the slime and tissue that surrounded him made me think of saliva and a tongue. A massive tongue to a massive creature. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I saw Cody&amp;#39;s face and gasped. It looked like he was being digested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The skin on his face was melting off in clumps, revealing the musculature underneath. His left eyebrow dripped off. The tissue surrounding him pulsated. He let out a small whimpery moan, and before I could even process, he fell into the steaming pit with the tongue still wrapped around him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ground quickly snapped back shut, like it had never happened, except for a gentle steam in the air. I stood in shock for just a moment before I began running. I scrambled back up the hill and ran all the way back to the cabin, my mind racing. It was snowing so hard by this point, our footprints from the way in were already becoming obscured. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I thankfully was able to find my way back in my panicked state before the snow completely covered our tracks. It wasn&amp;#39;t until I got back to the yard that I noticed my hand burning and realized the slime from the… whatever that was, was still on my hand. I frantically washed my hand in the snow, horrified at the thought of my skin melting away like Cody&amp;#39;s. I lost some skin on my palm, but it wasn&amp;#39;t as bad as it could have been.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I took a moment to compose myself before I ran inside, grabbed my keys, started up my shit box Ford and raced down the driveway as fast as the snow would let me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was grateful the closest town was on a popular trucking route, so there was a 24 hour diner with a payphone I could use. I froze when I got to the payphone, before I called 9-11, I decided to call my grandparents and be forthright about this. A kid just got swallowed into the earth on their property and I felt they deserved to know before I called the cops and a shit show started for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was probably 4 am at this point, I was exhausted and traumatized and the second I heard my grandma&amp;#39;s sleepy and concerned voice on the other end of the line, I lost it and began crying. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I admitted to using the cabin without her knowing and just said my friend disappeared in the night and I had to call the cops. She was very quiet for a moment. She told me to stay put at the diner, to contact the police, get a cup of coffee, and that her and Grandpa would be there in a few hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I called the cops next and sat at the diner nursing a cup of coffee while images of Cody&amp;#39;s face melting off kept replaying in my head. What the fuck was that thing? Did it hunt by luring people out using sympathy? Was it seriously a dismembered six foot long tongue banging on our door last night? I couldn&amp;#39;t tell the cops about this, they&amp;#39;d either think I was a loon or that I&amp;#39;d killed Cody myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The police came and took my statement. I kept it streamlined. I just said I woke up, heard the door close, saw Cody walk into the woods by himself in the middle of the night, and that I tried to follow, but had to turn back because of the weather and terrain. It was decided with the state of the storm that they would wait until daylight and for the snow to let up before taking me back out to the property to show them where he&amp;#39;d walked off to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A while after, my grandparents showed up and I burst into tears again. We sat in the sticky diner booth with cups of coffee in the pale morning light and I was able to explain the whole story. I felt embarrassed for telling them such a wild story, but I almost had to say it all out loud to someone else to make it real for myself, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amazingly, my grandparents looked very grave the whole time I talked and didn&amp;#39;t chastise me for telling tales. I thought I saw a knowing glance between them when I mentioned the banging on the front door. My grandmother&amp;#39;s face turned white when I described where and how Cody actually died.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is when they finally shared with me their side of this story and when I learned about Al disappearing the same way decades ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grandpa George lamented their lack of transparency with the family, but was grateful in a way to finally have closure. Grandma stayed quiet. I was honestly relieved that they believed me and had experienced the same events at the cabin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a while, the snow let up, we all got into my grandpa&amp;#39;s truck and made our way to the cabin to meet with police. When we got there, Grandma wandered away to look at the lake and I followed her. She looked austere, facing the mountains in the distance across the ice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I lied. I&amp;#39;ve lied for years. I always knew that thing was there,&amp;quot; she spoke to me softly, “I knew there was that evil here, on this land. The first summer I was up here, I witnessed it eat a full-grown buck. I tried to convince myself it wasn&amp;#39;t real. After Al was taken, though, I tried to kill it. Tried to blow it up with dynamite… it didn&amp;#39;t work.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She continued to gaze out over the fresh snow, blinding white in the morning light. I watched her steel herself as she took a deep breath.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I knew that evil was here, I didn&amp;#39;t want to believe and now we&amp;#39;ve both lost friends to it…” Grandma trailed off for a moment before she continued her thought with conviction, &amp;quot;but this view is just fantastic.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I reached out and held her hand as we gazed out over the lake and mountains together. A woodpecker flew overhead. Behind us, I could hear the police arriving and talking to Grandpa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My eyes filled up with tears.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yeah, Grandma, the view is awfully fantastic, isn&amp;#39;t it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/CheckUrCrawlspaces&quot;&gt; /u/CheckUrCrawlspaces &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2m95f/people_go_missing_on_my_grandparents_property_but/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2m95f/people_go_missing_on_my_grandparents_property_but/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c2m95f</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2m95f/people_go_missing_on_my_grandparents_property_but/" /><updated>2024-04-12T22:28:42+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-12T22:28:42+00:00</published><title>People go missing on my grandparent's property, but the view is just fantastic</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/ahufflepuffhere</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/ahufflepuffhere</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello! I would like to share an experience that I have through the game &amp;quot;Red door yellow door&amp;quot;. Before I start I want express that I do not believe something supernatural happened, I know that the game is mostly psychological. Lastly, I share this experience because I would love to here other experiences from this game.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, I tried the game with my friend at my home. We sat in my bed and she started saying &amp;quot;Red door Yellow door White door&amp;quot; multiple times. I tried to &amp;quot;imagine&amp;quot; some doors and then suddenly I started having a very clear image of my &amp;quot;surounding&amp;quot; in my mind. So, basically, what I started seeing was a dark brick hallway and in front of me where 3 doors. A brown door at my right, a yellow one in front of me and a red one at my left.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, she asked me what I see and I started explained to her the room. She asked which door I want to open and I told her that I would like to open the brown door at my right, so after that I went to the brown door and opened it. At first I saw nothing, it was just black but shortly after I saw a little far away a bench with a steet light next to it and a man sitting on it. The man had a long wizard hat and he was sitting as something was bothering him or just thinking. The man seemed to wear normal clothes, like a t-shirt or a jacket and pants but for some reason he also had his wizard hat on him. He had his one elbow on his leg and his hand on his head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyways, when I saw this I just couldn&amp;#39;t think anything and immediately started feeling very uncomfortable with the vibe. After 1 minute I think I just closed the door and I didn&amp;#39;t tell anything to my friend. I felt like I din&amp;#39;t want to tell her what I saw due to how uncomfortable I felt. Eventually, she pressured me to tell her and when I finally told her she got a little mad (with every right because is very important to tell everything to the guide person). After that I told her that I want to open the yellow door and I saw nothing. The same with the red door. When I told her that the 2 doors leaded to nothing she told me if I want to turn around and see what is behind me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I did and what I saw was the same dark brick hallway but this time it lead to 2 directions, left and right. In the middle wall was a light above, but the weird thing is that the light only lighted the right direction. The left direction was just black, as if there was an invisible wall that didn&amp;#39;t let the light to pass. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I describe to her what I saw she asked me where I want to go and explained to her tha I wanted to fo the right direction because the left one didn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;let&amp;quot; the light be bright to its direction and I was scared to see what is there. So, I walked and went to the right direction, after I turned my head to see what is there I saw the same hallway with 2 directions and a light in the middle of the wall but this time was a tall man standing there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t see his face because he was looking down and had his hood on since he was wearing something like a grey ? hoodie jacket. His hand were fisted as he was about to fight me lol. He also was wearing jeans and simple white shoes like the adidas? anyways&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though I couldn&amp;#39;t see his face, somehow I knew that he was around 25 years old and that he wasn&amp;#39;t the first man that I saw. He was someone else and also that he wanted to harm me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I told my friend immediately what I saw and she told me to turn around and leave, I did, I turned around and walked fast but I already felt him beside me and because I was scared I opened my eyes and we stopped the game.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My friend told me that my eyes where moving left and right all the time and also very fast, as I was &amp;quot;sleeping&amp;quot; you know and she could see my face when I felt uncomfortable and scared.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After that, when I opened my eyes I just started crying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So yeah, this was my experience with this game, what do you think? have any of you achieved this game?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/ahufflepuffhere&quot;&gt; /u/ahufflepuffhere &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2j6en/i_tried_the_red_door_yellow_door_game/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2j6en/i_tried_the_red_door_yellow_door_game/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c2j6en</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2j6en/i_tried_the_red_door_yellow_door_game/" /><updated>2024-04-12T20:19:19+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-12T20:19:19+00:00</published><title>I tried the red door yellow door game</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/Moist_Chance</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/Moist_Chance</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/wtIq0z3Ein&quot;&gt;Part 1 is here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, sorry it’s been so long between posts. I had to handle something that I’ll tell you all about later on. The situation is growing worse and I can attribute it all to this instance at my grandmother’s library. Stay on the lookout guys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;——————————————————————&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It took awhile to convince my mom to drive me to her parent’s house. She hadn’t visited them herself in years and Grandpa stopped coming to family gatherings after Grandma died. She said the last time she saw him something was off. When you looked at his eyes they were…empty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone attributed it to him grieving over his wife, and I had always just accepted that was the case. Maybe he knew the truth behind the fate of my Grandma. They said it was Alzheimer’s that caused her death. Claimed she had it for a very long time and she slowly deteriorated over years. Back then I didn’t bat an eye. “Old people die” I thought, but part of me felt there was more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I asked my mom for a ride, she didn’t even leave room for me to explain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“No, not a chance in hell I’m driving you to Pa’s, he ain’t been right in a long time. I’ve told you this before.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But Mom, I-“&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“End of discussion. It’s not safe. God knows what his reaction will be to some kid rummaging around his home.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m his grandson, mom.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Not to him you ain’t. Do you realize that he never once asked me your name? I mean the nerve of this guy.” She says scoffing and turning her back to continue washing dishes. “It’s like after grandma died, so did he. Like he’s some soulless freak who replaced my father.” I can hear her fighting back emotion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I need to do this Mom. I don’t expect you to understand, but please. Grandma’s stories were special to me and I want to see if she wrote any down that I can read. I know she was an author.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The room went silent for a while. I could hear my heart beating out of my chest. My mom gave it some thought then she hung her head and sighed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Two hours. You get two hours, but I’m not going inside.” I could hear the pain in her solemn voice. I couldn’t imagine what it would be like for her to return to her childhood home with only a memory of her mother and a husk of her father.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s more than enough time. Just keep the car warm for me.” I said with a smile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Now get out of my face and put your coat on.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I ran to my room, grabbed my coat, and ran back out before she took her apron off. I waited anxiously on the couch as my mom got ready. I swear she took longer on purpose just to spite me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The drive was short. It’s surprising how much distance can be made between people so close together. The house was tall and wide, the type of house you expected to see for a back of the woods family home from the 20s. The roof was in rough shape and the sidings were splintering out. Vines climbed all over the house and the lawn was up to my waist. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Remember, you have two hours. Not a second later you hear me?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yes ma’am.” I said as I leaped out of the car. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ll be here waiting. Be careful honey! Don’t take too long I better not be out here waiting I will drive-“&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her voice fades as I jogged up the stone path to the front door. As I stood on the front steps, I got a view of the house. I’ve seen vines wrap buildings before, but not like this. They wrapped tightly around the building causing breaks in the siding as if squeezing the house. The vines were acting like a cage containing something. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I put my hand on the door and gave it a slight nudge, the door creaked open. I guess my grandpa never had to worry about any intruders coming all the way back here. I peeked my head in and looked around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The house was silent. It smelled of smoke and mold. The rooms were dark with one light illuminating a room to my right. I took one step and spoke sheepishly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hello? Grandpa? It’s your grandson. I&amp;#39;ve come to ask a few questions.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I heard a slight stir followed by silence. I took another step and asked out again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hello? I just want to ask a few things about Grandma. I always loved her stories.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Go away boy. I’ve got nothing for you here.” I heard in a thundering voice with as much malice as one could imagine in a man defending his home could muster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I just need a few minutes of your time.” I kept creeping towards the light. I could see a couch come into view followed by a coffee table and a recliner. I peaked my head around the entryway and looked around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There sat a gruff old man in jeans and a black jacket. The recliner lined his body as if he hadn’t gotten up in ages. His hair and beard were unkept and I couldn’t tell if the smell was the house or him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Didn’t your parents ever teach you manners? I said, get going.” He yelled, posturing up and reaching for something on his side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Grandpa, sir, I just want to talk.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Talking ain’t ever good for much you should know.” He said as I could see him hide the barrel of a gun on the opposite side of his recliner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I just need a few minutes, then I’ll leave you alone.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Out with it then.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Of course.” I plopped down onto the couch next to him. The action of me sitting kicks up a decades worth of dust. I don’t mind though, I could see the answers to all my questions within arms reach. “I wanted to talk about Grandma.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Merida, the loveliest lady I’ve ever met.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Tell me about her. What was she like?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“She was like the sun after a downpour. Like the first bite of a fresh home cooked meal. Nothing could compare to a lady like her.” He had a slight smile while talking. It went away with his next line. “She was never right, boy. I knew that, we all did.” All joy left his body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What do you mean?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You see, I’d always catch her whispering to herself. Some crazy mumblings or the like. Then I’d always see her staring. Like someone just shot her dog in front of her. Thing is, nothing would be there. She’d just stare and mumble. It didn’t happen frequently enough to warrant any big warning. I didn’t mind much and so we got married. They only got worse and more often as she aged. She’d say things like ‘it’s in my head’ and ‘get out of me.’ Felt bad that I couldn&amp;#39;t help her. I just wish she would’ve told me about it all.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I couldn’t gauge his emotions. Was it anger? Sadness? Guilt? I leaned closer to him. I didn’t want to interrupt him. He was speaking the pent up words of decades past. I think he took this as an opportunity for himself to process it all. It was for him as much as it was for me. Part of me wanted to reach out and put a hand on him for comfort. At the time I could only dig deeper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Did she ever tell you what she was seeing?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“No, not while alive.” He motioned to a small book on the corner table next to him. “She left me this before she died.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s in it?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Everything. She explains her affliction, how she tried to cope, and her studies into what they were.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Who’s they?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Shadow People.” He looked up and locked onto my eyes. He stared studiously trying to gauge my reaction. I think he sensed my fear and spoke. “You’ve started seeing them too, haven’t you?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I- I don’t-“&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Save your words. How old are you?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“18 years as of a month ago.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That checks out. Same time she started seeing them. She wrote that this family was special. They had the ability to see. She didn’t go into details about it just that she, much like those before her, were able to see things that weren’t there. Or maybe they could see things that others couldn’t.” He took a second to ponder the thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Does that mean I’m…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Seems like it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Why didn’t my mother say anything? Shouldn’t she see them too?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I suppose it skips a generation.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The realization that I shared the same fate with my grandmother came over me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Am I going to end up like her?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s not something I nor she knows the answer to.” He hanged his head solemnly as if he’d just delivered a cancer diagnosis. “Thing is, she never knew her grandmother much. Her dad never talked about his mother. Seems there wasn’t much to mention seeing as she died shortly after childbirth. Same thing, early dementia, or so they say.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So my great great grandmother could see too?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s the most likely explanation. Seems Merida was the only one who’s lived a full life in recent history.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Through his nonchalant attitude, I could tell this retelling was taking a burden on him. I figured now would be the best time to pursue the library. I’ve never seen someone so passionate to share their life, while being so sad about what’s happened. My mom was right, he looked like he&amp;#39;d lost his eyes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t have any more questions. Thank you for everything. Before I go, can I look at Grandma’s library? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s the least I can do.” He reached for the drawer of the corner table and pulled out a key. “Be careful. I haven’t been there for years. Probably in worse shape than the other parts of the house.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ok, will do.” I got up and walked to the door my grandpa pointed towards. It was down a long hallway with a row of windows looking to the outside. I looked for my mother’s van. She’s still there waiting for me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I reached the door and inserted the key, jostling the old lock until it opened. I slowly opened the door trying not to breathe in the mold and dust swirling visibly around the room. Tall shelves filled with books of varying conditions lined the walls. I scoured the shelves looking for her name. After half an hour of looking, I found the pocket of the shelves I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Recollections of the Shadows by Merida Louis.” It was a series of books. 4 in total, each about 300 pages long. I grabbed all four and started skimming through them. Their appearance indicated they hadn’t been touched past when they were made. The passages showed each time Merida saw a shadow person. Each entry used to be months apart, but as I looked through each book, the dates grew closer and closer together. I figured now wasn’t the time to start reading intensively but I had what I needed to know this was the right source for information. I chose to read a few passages. What felt like hours passed. I was so engrossed with the entries I had forgotten about the time; however, it wasn&amp;#39;t my mother coming to check on me that took me out of my trance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was sitting at my grandmother’s desk facing the hallway. In the dimly lit hallway, I could see movement out of the corner of my eye. I figured it was my grandfather getting out of his recliner to come check on me. It got closer, slowly creeping down the hall, like it was stalking its prey. It stopped 10 feet away. I stopped skimming, looked up, and froze with an eerie realization filling my consciousness. I stood up and stared down the hallway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s back and it’s closer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I stumbled until my back was to the wall. In a similar manner, the shadow mimicked my movement, falling into an invisible wall. Something was different about it this time. It didn’t need to slouch to match my height, and its eyes were more rounded and wide. It still scrunched its arms to thin itself, but its movements were more fluid. It got better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shadow was also closer than before, close enough I could see it clearly. The void once rejected by our world was allowed to exist. The world no longer warped around it, it was simply apparent. It was almost as if the world had welcomed it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of intense debate, I decided that I’d use the strategy I had last time. Light was the answer to forcing it away. I scanned the room for the light switch but couldn’t find any. House was so old the library didn’t have a central light. I looked for a lamp and found one stashed in the corner by the door. It was standing next to an outlet, all I had to do was plug it in. I looked back to the hall. It moved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shadow took the opportunity while I was distracted to approach. Now it was inches from the doorway. So close I could feel the air being sucked into it, leaving nothing but a cold breeze filling the surrounding space. I stared into the vast nothingness, a volume of empty space stood with malicious intent. The figure looked at me as if it knew the situation it forced me into. I had to approach it to reach my salvation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wasn’t going down like this, there were still so many answers I needed to find. I slowly walked toward the lamp in the corner, being cautious not to break my line of sight. It stopped mimicking me, only moving its eyes in tandem with my movement. Then, in one quick motion I ran to the lamp, and in one motion the shadow flew toward me. Its force pushing me against the bookshelf. Our distance remained the same as when it stood in the door. 7 feet away it stood in the middle of the room smiling at me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was pinned against the bookshelf unable to move an inch in any direction. There was a radius around it that barred my entry. It was a sphere of distorted reality that rejected me at every turn. It didn’t move either, we just remained in this stalemate for an infinite amount of time. Its face would try to shape into looks of fear and horror. It had an exaggerated expression that it wore, mocking my despair. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I lost hope, it wasn’t going to let me leave, but then I heard a loud bang. My grandfather aimed down the barrel of his shotgun that was still smoking from the recent shot. The shadow was unphased, but in the moment its focus was diverted. It started to walk towards my grandfather, but he dashed to the opposite side of the library. The shadow followed him and another shot rang out at the ground. My grandpa reloaded his gun but the shadow was a step quicker. It pushed him down hard into the floor, but the old timer recovered quickly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“NOW’S YOUR CHANCE. RUN, SAM!” He yells, aiming again and letting another round off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I grabbed the stack of books near the desk and ran out into the hallway. As I ran, the darkness outside transitioned into a bright light. I kept running through the living room and out the door, being sure not to miss a step in fear of being caught. I heard a scream of pain followed by another shot in the air. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I ran out onto the front lawn and saw my mom’s van. I banged on the window and startled my mother, patiently typing on her laptop. She unlocked the door and I threw it open.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Honey, what’re you doing here? What happened? It&amp;#39;s only been an hour?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Mom, you have to drive GO GO!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You’re acting crazy, what did he do to you?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I- I can’t explain it, let&amp;#39;s just go!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She accelerated the car and we drove onto the gravel road. As the house grew further and further away, I had the courage to look back. The vines were gone and the house looked to be renovated. The roof was brand new, the sidings were freshly painted, and the lawn was freshly cut.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I didn’t speak the whole ride home. When we got home, I went straight to my room and plopped on my bed. My mother knocked on my bedroom door, but I didn&amp;#39;t respond. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nothing but questions filled my mind again. After everything I learned from what my grandfather told me, I was only left with more questions. I started recalling all the events. The interview, the passages in the books, and the encounter with the shadow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My grandmother and I shared an ability to see the shadows. An ability that’s been passed down for generations. She slowly lost her mind as a result and was never of sane mind. I might share in this fate if I don’t find a way to stop it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think back to the encounter. The shadow was no longer a passive bystander. It stood freakishly in the corner with a smirk when it wasn’t copying my face. It knew it was getting closer to me, but not close enough to touch me. I still don’t know its motives, but it knows its goals aren&amp;#39;t far away. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then my grandfather. That would be the last day I ever saw him. He was pronounced dead 2 weeks later when my mother requested a wellness check. I never told her the full details of that day, and she knows to this day that I’m hiding something from her. I said he freaked out when he found me sneaking out of his house after raiding the library. She didn’t hear the gunshots. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The funeral was rushed and only my family and a few strangers came to give their condolences. In his last days he made many enemies out of his loved ones. Only reason I was able to go was because I begged my family to go. Someone also had to front the bill. At the time, I was grieving for having been the one to escape. I left him, and he died alone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I couldn’t explain one thing about that night. How did he know my name?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Moist_Chance&quot;&gt; /u/Moist_Chance &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2kqj6/has_anyone_heard_of_shadow_people_part_2/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2kqj6/has_anyone_heard_of_shadow_people_part_2/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c2kqj6</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c2kqj6/has_anyone_heard_of_shadow_people_part_2/" /><updated>2024-04-12T21:24:45+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-12T21:24:45+00:00</published><title>Has anyone heard of Shadow People?

A college campus full of inhuman creatures and idiots with too much newfound freedom and not enough life experience is a recipe for disasters. I say that as one of those idiots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Working at the dining hall has some unexpected benefits. For one thing, we get free leftovers at the end of the day. We get paid. And… that’s about all the benefits I can think of off the top of my head. I was going somewhere with this but now that I think about it, “finding out about obscure inhuman creatures on campus” might not actually be a benefit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not talking about the manager. This is something else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before I get into it, let me just update everyone on the thing in the hallway situation. Other than some absolutely horrific nightmares that I don’t want to talk about, we haven’t made any progress. I’m not surprised. We’ve already figured out that all these creatures on campus don’t exist in folklore so the Folklore Society isn’t going to have much luck finding them in the library’s books. I haven’t been involved in the process. Maria has declared that this is not my responsibility. She’ll let me know if she needs help and keep me apprised of what’s going on, but this is something for her to deal with. She can’t stop anyone in the club from doing something reckless, but she can make sure she’s there to warn them off at every opportunity. At the very least, she can ensure that they’re fully aware of the very permanent and very fatal consequences of making a mistake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m relieved to have friends to help with this. I don’t have to do everything alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also I feel like this might mean I don’t fulfill the devil’s request and I’m perfectly okay with that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back to the dining hall job. We’ve been running low on trays. Yes, those plastic cafeteria trays you use to carry your food and drink to your table with. It’s not unusual for them to go missing. People use them to carry their meal back to their dorm and then forget to return them until weeks later, often with accompanying stacks of plates so old they probably belong in the geology department’s fossil collection. I’m so grateful for industrial dishwashers. So very very grateful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s another way that the trays go missing though. I’d just started my shift when the manager called me over to ask me to do a special job. I was a little nervous, because I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; my former boss lady has talked to him about the whole… eating… thing… but he hasn’t said a word to me about it. Fortunately, he decided to have the conversation with me in the kitchen with all the other student employees around rather than, I dunno, in the freezer where they wouldn’t hear my screams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I need you to go get the trays,” he said. “I just saw a group leaving with some too, so tell them to cut it out while you’re at it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I stared blankly at him for a moment. Was I supposed to go door to door asking for them or something? When he realized that I had no idea what was going on, he hurriedly elaborated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Students take them to go sledding, he said. On the hill at the far end of the campus parking lot. The hill that’s rumored to be merely a covered garbage heap because this part of the US doesn’t have hills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apparently it’s a &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; around here. Students steal the trays and slide down the hill on them. They only get brought back about a third of the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But there’s no snow out right now!” you’re surely thinking. “There will never be snow again because global warming is going to kill us all!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Correct.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But do you really need snow when you’ve got mud? With as much as it rains around here, we’ve got plenty of mud.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You want me to hike out to the far end of campus, where it’s remote and isolated, and demand a group of students give us back our trays?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Exactly!” he said. “And bring back any discarded ones you find out there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So he’s trying to get me killed I guess. But to give him the benefit of the doubt, I asked why he was sending me, of all people. He looked confused for a moment and said I was the most obvious choice. He knew I could handle it. Then I noticed that my coworkers were giving me the thumbs-up and I stg one of them mouthed “go get ‘em Ashley!” at me, like I’m a dog they’re siccing on some hapless squirrels. It seemed that everyone agreed that I was best suited for the manager’s search and &lt;del&gt;destroy&lt;/del&gt; retrieve mission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Am I intimidating or something? I don’t feel that way. I certainly don’t look like it. Maybe I’ve dealt with enough inhuman bullshit by now that I’ve developed a “don’t mess with me” aura? Or perhaps it’s the trauma. Let’s be real - I’ve seen some shit and I can say that unironically. Perhaps that has actually made me a little immune to getting worked up over regular old nonsense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; broad daylight so a walk over to the edge of the parking lot wasn’t that big of an ask.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were six people at the hill when I arrived. They’d clearly been sledding, as evidenced by the mud covering the bottoms of their trays and the jeans of one hapless person that had clearly wiped out once already. I’m not sure what the appeal of sliding down a muddy hill on a plastic tray was, but maybe it’s just one of those weird local traditions that I missed out on because I’m not that social of a person. Cassie probably heard about it. This just isn’t the sort of thing she’d want to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strangely, I didn’t see any trays strewn about the bottom of the hill. My manager was going to be disappointed. He’s been grumbling for weeks now about having to reorder a bunch of food after the last time he went all Pacman on it. He’s not going to be happy about having to order new trays on top of it. I resolved to get the six trays the students had with them back at the very least.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I waved at them as I approached. I’d left my work apron behind, so there was no way to tell I was there on behalf of Official Dining Hall business. They waved back but otherwise seemed prepared to ignore me. I stopped at the base of the hill. It’s definitely a man-made hill. It’s maybe the size of a two-story house with steep sides, like a pimple on the landscape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I need the trays,” I said. “The dining hall wants them back.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group paused and stared at me in unison. The atmosphere shifted, turning both awkward and hostile. Mostly awkward, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“No,” one of them finally said. A girl in the back giggled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yes,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then we just stared at each other in this weird sort of stand-off, where they weren’t quite sure if they should resume what they were doing, both because I was acting like I had authority to tell them not to and also probably because I’d chosen to stand at the base of where they’d been sliding, judging by the trail of mud at my feet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe my manager didn’t send me here because I’m intimidating. Maybe he sent me here because he knew I’d make this so uncomfortable that they’d give up and leave me the trays.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is stupid,” the girl in the back huffed. “Get out of the way.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She set the tray on the ground at the top of the hill. Got on it. I braced myself. Fine. She could run into me. I might not be that strong, but I felt my odds of knocking her off that stupid tray and into the mud when she reached me were pretty good. Then she shoved off, her friends stepped aside to let her glide past, and the hill opened up around her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like a mouth. It split in two, a gaping chasm from one side of the hill to the other with jagged teeth made out of the splintered remains of the missing cafeteria trays. A rank smell emanated from its depths, a stench like rotting meat and spoiled milk. I almost gagged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She slid straight into it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other students around here were losing their footing as the hill split open, falling over and rolling or sliding down its side. I distantly heard their panicked shouts, as if I were listening to them from underwater. My gaze was fixed on the girl just ahead of me on the hillside, watching her body tumble down into the hill, her fall arrested as she latched both hands onto one of the hill’s teeth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her eyes met mine. I saw the confused terror in them. It had happened so fast, the hill opening up beneath her, but I still saw the realization in her face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She knew she was about to die. She didn’t know why or how, but she knew that something horrible was happening to her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I think that was what broke me out of my trance. That moment of human contact, when our eyes locked. The hill was moving about, the earth rippling, like it was trying to swallow, trying to shake her off its lip and into the darkness of its throat. But that upper jaw was closing, the gaping chasm that was its mouth inexorably closing around her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I lunged forward, digging my feet into the muddy hillside. She stretched out a hand for me, the other still clinging desperately to the jagged tooth. I grabbed hold, her muddy fingers slipping with mine, and then I latched my other hand around her wrist to stabilize my grip.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I pulled. My feet began to slide in the mud. We were going forward, not backwards, towards the depths of the creature’s mouth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then a pair of arms wrapped around my waist. I heard yelling but in my panic I couldn’t discern the words. I stopped sliding on the mud and then I felt a tug, I was moving backwards, and I was dragging the girl with me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We almost had her free. We were so close.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then the hill slammed its mouth shut.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I didn’t let go. The people anchoring me didn’t let go. She screamed and screamed and went limp in my grasp but we didn’t let go. We kept pulling and then with a wet sucking sound, we ripped her free of the hillside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I fell over backwards and tumbled down to the base of the hill. Then I lay there, stunned, listening to the chaos around me. Someone was crying. Someone else was screaming. And someone, thank goodness, had the presence of mind to call 911.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’d managed to collect my wits by the time the ambulance arrived. The girl was alive. We’d pulled her out in time. She even still had both of her legs. Granted, they were both &lt;em&gt;broken&lt;/em&gt;, but they were still attached to her body. Two &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; broken legs are awful, but it was still a lot better than it could have been. She didn’t make a sound while the paramedics were loading her up but I suspect that was more from shock than relief to be alive. &lt;em&gt;I’m&lt;/em&gt; relieved she’s alive. So was everyone else that had helped pull her out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I walked with them back towards campus with the stolen cafeteria trays tucked under one arm. They were frantically discussing what the heck they were going to do about this. The hill had tried to &lt;em&gt;eat her&lt;/em&gt;. They all saw it. Did they go to campus security? The police? Should they keep quiet because surely no one was going to believe them?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was about to speak up when one of them threw up his hands, declared that this was all insane and he was going back to his dorm, and walked off. No one went after him. I watched him go while the remainder started discussing what they should do about the hill. When he passed the corner of a building, something detached itself from the wall and began to walk behind him. Something with skin patterned like bricks and with long fingers that dangled all the way down to its bony knees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I felt a knot in my throat. If I ran - if I caught up enough to at least yell at him -&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I did nothing. I stood there and watched until they were both out of sight. And then I too walked off, leaving the remaining students behind to figure this out on their own. It wouldn’t matter, whatever they decided. The college would make sure they forgot about it and they’d think their friend broke her legs in some stupid, ordinary, accident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can’t protect them. And even if they knew, they couldn’t protect themselves. They have to sleep at some point and the Forgetter can get into their dorm rooms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s for the best. Knowing about the inhuman around here certainly hasn’t made my life - or anyone else’s - better. Maybe the Forgetter is here to protect the students as much as the college itself. If they forget and go on with their lives, then maybe the inhuman won’t distinguish them from any other student on campus. They have the list of rules but they don’t have to believe it, not until they &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to. And after that? Once they forget and return to boring normalcy?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then maybe they won’t continue to be magnets for the inhuman. Like I am. Like Cassie and Maria and now the Folklore Society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wonder if that is what the flickering man meant, when he said he’d seen people like me before and that there would be more like me after I was gone. Are we the lightning rods? The sacrifices to keep the inhumans sated and away from the bulk of the student body? Is this why the campus resurrected the Folklore Society after it was on the verge of disbanding?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So many questions and I know everyone is going to say who I should talk to about them. Good news: I did talk to Grayson. When I saw the Forgetter slink off I knew its hands would be busy with quite a few people. That meant I had a window of opportunity in which to talk to Grayson and to remember what was said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I called him and asked if he could meet me somewhere on campus. He readily agreed. Since it was somewhat nice out (and by that I mean not raining) we found a bench to sit on outdoors. I took a deep breath, reminded myself that we were friends and friends were honest and just wanted the best for each other. We weren’t dating. I didn’t have to be the perfect girlfriend anymore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Your dad isn’t alive, is he?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I told him that I stopped by his house and got sucked into this awful situation where I was mistaken for him and didn’t know how to extricate myself. I admit that I cried a bit. I do feel guilty about it. Really guilty. But Grayson just sighed and ran his hands through his hair. He didn’t seem angry about it. He seemed… frustrated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s fine,” he said when I finished. “You’re not telling me anything I don’t already know.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Then - you knew he was dead all along?” I ventured.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m not sure dead is quite the right term. I mean… he’s there, isn’t he? His mind or soul or whatever it is.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was quiet for a moment. Undead, then? Or alive and rotting? Did semantics &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matter?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is why his memory is going,” I said quietly. “Isn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is. At some point he’ll be so rotten he can’t function anymore. Then they’ll want a new president. They’ll demand one.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You?” I asked, almost breathless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grayson laughed softly, bitterly. His hands were clasped together in his lap. His knuckles were white.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“No, I’ve managed to avoid taking that role. They’ve always found someone else and just slid him into that position like nothing changed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Is your dad…” I whispered, not wanting to say it, unable to stop myself, “...not your first dad?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ve lost track of how many there have been,” he replied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So what, they just - give you a new dad when the old one falls apart? Not even a real dad but a - a &lt;em&gt;corpse?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was starting to get angry at this point. Appalled, yes, but also very very angry. I mean, my dad was gone. He died. And if someone tried to slip in a replacement - not even a person, but a rotting animated corpse! - I don’t know if I could sit there and handle it as quietly as Grayson was. How was he not spending every waking moment consumed with anger? How has he not burned this fucking place to the ground already?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it’s really for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;,” he said thoughtfully. “It’s more that the university needs a president. I just happen to be part of the package.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Somehow that made it even worse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“How long has this been going on?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As early as I remember. There was…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He raised his head and stared hollowly into the sky. His gaze was distant and unfocused. Then he took a deep breath and shook himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s the tree,” he sighed. “The tree is why they don’t last.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The roots. They were everywhere now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Is it… why you look so tired now?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He nodded, turning his head sideways and giving me a sad smile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry. This is a lot to burden you with. It’s okay though. This is my last year here.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I hate this place,” I said. “I wish I’d never come here.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hey. Don’t say that.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He turned towards me and grabbed my hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Listen. You wanted to leave your hometown, right? That’s why you’re here. Don’t lose sight of that - you came here because you wanted to do something &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; with your life - and you are! You left! You changed your life! That’s what I love about you. And I’m going to leave too - I have a plan, don’t worry - and it’ll all be better.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wish I could believe that. I really do. But I do feel this - maybe I can trust Grayson or maybe I can’t, but he needs to get out of this place. Leave, like I did. I see myself in him, trapped by the expectations of everyone around him, caged in by how things should be because that’s how they’ve always been.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s wrong. It’s why this whole damn campus feels like it&amp;#39;s rotting at the core. But we’re both going to graduate and then we’re going to leave and we’ll never &lt;a href=&quot;https://alderrayne.com/&quot;&gt;come&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/&quot;&gt;back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/fainting--goat&quot;&gt; /u/fainting--goat &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1z5rk/how_to_survive_college_new_rule_dont_steal_the/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1z5rk/how_to_survive_college_new_rule_dont_steal_the/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c1z5rk</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1z5rk/how_to_survive_college_new_rule_dont_steal_the/" /><updated>2024-04-12T03:33:59+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-12T03:33:59+00:00</published><title>How to Survive College - new rule: don't steal the cafeteria trays to use as sleds</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/MarzBars_</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/MarzBars_</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m hiding under the covers tonight. Just like every night for the past 6 months. Groaning footsteps grow closer. They’re slow. Sounding all too familiar. There&amp;#39;s a drawn out creak from my door. She shuffles over closer to me. Standing over my bed. All she does is stare. I pretend not to notice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s been just my mother and I for years. Until one night after a walk in the woods she came home ill. I tried to convince her to go into town to find a doctor. But she just said it was nothing more than the common cold and that it would be impolite to go bothering the doctor over nothing. Mom’s wrong, this isn’t just some common cold. I fear that something is seriously wrong with her. Mom always said I’m too young to be talking with strangers online. But after her abrupt loss of appetite, then followed by her most recent… craving, I feel as if I have no other choice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I trudged through damp air, taking in the fresh scent of rain-soaked earth. Pine trees stood tall, pointed like spikes impaling through the earth. The blade of my shovel dragged behind me through the mud. I clutched my flashlight, lighting up the path ahead. The wind howled a low cry. Each time the underbush rustled from the wind I could feel the pace of my heart race and my chest tighten. I’d focus my flashlight on the noise, for there to be nothing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of walking I found an open clearing. I struck the blade of my shovel into the mud. Digging my heel into the back of the blade I drove it deeper into the ground. Pulling back the handle a hunk of mud and grass overturned. The pink squirming bodies of worms, caked in wet mud, glistened in the moonlight. I took out the folded trash bag from my back pocket. I plucked each worm from the dirt mound and dropped them into the bag. One by one. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writhing bag dragged behind me as I walked. I could see my family’s cabin up ahead. From the windows a yellow haze of light pours out into the night. The silhouette of a thin woman stood in the window. Unnaturally swaying where she stands. Her head turns to face me. Mom is watching me. As I entered through the back porch I could already feel her gaze piercing into me. I fastened the deadbolts to the porch door and placed the bag on the dining table. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hi mom, I’m home” I announced. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mom wore a pale blue gown, the fabric hung limp over her frame. Her eyes sunk back into a dark gaze. The skin beneath her eyes sagged. Deep frown lines were etched into the surface of her face. Discolored hues and prominent blue veins decorated her skin. Her breathing was low and labored. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sit down Mom. You need your rest” I pleaded, with concern in my voice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I held her, leading her back to bed. Mom’s thin fingers wrapped around mine. The pulse of her heart faintly tapped through her veins. Her skin felt taught, like leather bound over bone. She trembled with each step, leaning into me for support. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A squeaky creak let out from the door as I pushed it open. The light from the hallways spilled into her dark room. The cold air prickled at my skin. I guided her to the bed and propped up her pillows. Then laid her to rest. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her body laid frail in her king bed. As if she’d disappear between the creases of the covers. Her trembling arm reached out to me. She stroked her through my hair. A familiar gesture of gentle comfort. Then interrupted by nails scratching into the flesh of my scalp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I grabbed the remote from her night stand and turned on the TV. The soft glow of the screen filled the room. She didn’t turn to look at the TV. She fixed her gaze on me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Don’t worry, I’ll be right back Mom.” I whispered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I closed the door behind me. Hurriedly I made my way back to the kitchen table. The bag had toppled over. A handful of worms spilled out onto the table. I flailed my hands, scooping them up and placing them back into the bag. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I pushed open the door to her room, bag in hand. She stood at the end of the bed. Her eyes were fixed on the doorway. I could hear a low growl from under her breath. Unsteady she swayed from side to side. Hesitantly I inched towards her. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Mom, you know you need to rest. I’ve got your meal for tonight right here.” I shook the bag in my hand to show her. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She stilled. The low growling noise began to fade. I eased towards Mom, so as not to startle her. I rested my hand on mom’s shoulder as I guided her back to the bed. I propped her up on fluffed pillows. Inside the bag a teeming mass of worms awaited. I plucked one plump, slimy worm from the writhing mass. The pink body of the worm wiggled. Trying in vain to break free. Mom looked up at me, expectantly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I plopped the first worm in her mouth. The worm went down, smooth and slow. Then from the bag I plucked another. One worm at a time. I could see the veins begin to squirm beneath her skin. Color began to flush across her face. A subtle brightness began showing in her eyes. Her lips crawled into a faint smile. One by one. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“All gone.” I shook the empty bag in front of her. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Good night, don’t let the bedbugs bite.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I left I felt her eyes on me. Watching me. I closed the door behind me. The house is quiet tonight. Only the creaking of my footsteps echo out. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m hiding under the covers tonight. Just like every night for the past 6 months. Groaning footsteps grow closer. They’re slow. Sounding all too familiar. There&amp;#39;s a drawn out creak from my door. I hear her shuffling over. Closer to me. Standing over my bed. All she does is stare. I pretend not to notice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m hiding with my phone under the covers. I can’t make the journey into town all alone by foot to get a doctor. Mom watches my every movement. I don’t think she’d let me leave. I’m writing out for someone, anyone to hear me. We need help. And I’m so afraid of being alone here. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/MarzBars_&quot;&gt; /u/MarzBars_ &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c20ekf/mom_is_sick/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c20ekf/mom_is_sick/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c20ekf</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c20ekf/mom_is_sick/" /><updated>2024-04-12T04:41:49+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-12T04:41:49+00:00</published><title>Mom is Sick</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/Theeaglestrikes</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/Theeaglestrikes</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, they &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to be people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My name is Danica Craven, and I’ve been an archaeologist for the past decade. Tantalising opportunities often fall into my lap. Some drenched relic washes up on an Egyptian beach, or a lonesome fossil is uncovered. But I’m often beaten to the punch. That’s the nature of the game. And, as the years go by, fewer ancient gems remain undiscovered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consequently, last December, I was dumbfounded by a lead in the Bavarian Alps. Being the first one to the scene is a gift that shouldn’t be squandered. My team and I investigated a frosty nook near Zugspitze — Germany’s mightiest mountain. Two days earlier, in the wake of a fearsome blizzard, a misshapen steel panel was found in the snow, halfway up a steep cliff-side. Amir Langton and I had suspicions regarding its origin. Suspicions confirmed when our team unearthed something near to the site at which the panel was found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Concrete.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I &lt;em&gt;told&lt;/em&gt; you!” I gloated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I know you did,” Amir laughed. “But temper your expectations, Danny. We don’t know what we’ve found. There may not be an entrance.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Oh, it’s there,” I assured him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, an hour later, there came the satisfying clunk of metal against metal. Enzo Flores, our chief digger, had uncovered a lofty, metallic door. Depleted by a day’s work, he finally let his shovel fall into the snow. We followed suit, dropping our tools. Though I’d been digging significantly slower than the burly labourers, I still felt a sense of achievement. A smile broadened across my cheeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Crikey… That’s been hidden under the snow for &lt;em&gt;decades&lt;/em&gt;,” Amir whispered. “Unbelievable.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You love that word, don’t you?” I smiled. “Even when we get inside and see undeniable proof, you’ll still call me delusional.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Well, that’s the thing,” He said, scratching his neck. “How &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; we get in there?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Not with this measly equipment,” Enzo said. “We’ll need something heavy-duty to breach the door.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The man, a hulking figure with rosy, frosted cheeks, led us out of the snow tunnel that we’d spent hours digging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Explosives?” Anselm Becker asked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Calm down, kid. A hydraulic system should do the trick,” Enzo said. “But we aren’t opening it tonight. Snow’s coming down. The daylight has gone. Everyone’s cold and tired.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I huffed. “But we–”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“– Not tonight, Miss Craven,” Enzo insisted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Amir?” I said, turning to my friend for assistance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My colleague shrugged. “Sorry, Danica. We won’t be able to do anything without Enzo and his men.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But this is an undiscovered German stronghold,” I said. “In 24 hours, we won’t be the only people here. You know that local will already have told everyone about the panel he found.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’re going to pack up and head to the town,” Enzo said firmly. “I’ll see you in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An idea came to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Amir, let’s camp here,” I said. “Guard the tunnel. Stake a claim. This is our site, and I don’t want anyone to take it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I would strongly advise against that, Miss Craven,” Enzo cautioned, rubbing a gloved hand against his red brow. “Other than tourists in the igloo resort, nobody sleeps on the mountain. Wild camping isn’t safe.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Leave a tent for us, and we’ll be fine,” I promised. “Amir, are you happy to stay with me?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My partner nodded. “Sure, Danny.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enzo growled, barging past us and beginning to pack his equipment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We do appreciate your help, Enzo,” I said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Y’don’t need to appreciate it,” He huffed. “I don’t get paid to be appreciated. And I sure as &lt;em&gt;shit&lt;/em&gt; don’t get paid to babysit.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With that, Enzo Flores and his men began walking down the mountainous slope below us — heading towards the warm embrace of lights in the town.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry, Amir,” I said as we tucked ourselves into our sleeping bags.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He shrugged, smiling. “I respect you, Danica. You’re more dedicated to this line of work than anyone I know. You deserve this find. So, let’s guard it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m being paranoid,” I sighed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“No doubt about that,” Amir chuckled. “But it doesn’t hurt to be safe, does it? We’d kick ourselves if someone were to invade our freshly-dug site. We’ve done the hard work.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I smirked. “I mean… It was mostly done by Enzo.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; mostly done by Enzo,” Amir agreed, and we laughed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Thanks,” I said. “You’re always so level-headed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s a talent of mine,” He grinned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I dozed off, I had never felt safer in my life. Wrapped in a snug, cotton cocoon, I was soothed by shrieking gusts and the rippling tent fabric. Our tent blocked the entrance to the snow tunnel — the gateway to a hidden WWII shelter. It was the jewel of my career. My life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That cosy feeling of accomplishment didn’t last, however. Amir and I were woken by a husky bellow in the early hours of the morning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What was that?” My friend panted, sitting upright.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t know,” I breathlessly replied, rubbing my eyes. “It sounded–”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was interrupted by the sound of snow crunching beneath immense weight. Something too heavy and slow to be human.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There must be an animal out there,” Amir whispered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What animals would be caught in this blizzard?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it wasn’t a person. Neither of us contested that. The crunches were too loud. Though our bodily instincts should’ve kept us inside, our intrigued minds got the better of us. Mother always said curiosity would be the death of me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amir cleared his throat. “Do you…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“– Yes,” I answered before he finished his question.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My colleague tentatively opened the zip to the tent, and we peeked at the darkened mountain, shrouded by an incessant downpour of white flecks. Near the rim of our campsite, illuminated by the tall spotlight Enzo had left behind, deep tracks led through the snow. Something had skirted around the edge of the site. And, for a haunting second, beyond the spotlight, I saw a black shape flit out of view — a towering figure concealed by torrential snowfall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Did you see that?” I cried in horror.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“No,” Amir replied, frowning. “What was it?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t know,” I said. “It didn’t look like an animal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Well, no person made those tracks,” He said, nodding at the enormous footprints. “It had to be a… I don’t know. What time is it?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I checked my watch. “Nearly four in the morning. Enzo and the others should be here in a few hours.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My friend nodded. “Let’s go back to sleep. We’ll stay quiet. If the animal were planning to attack us, it already would’ve done so.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Amir, I’ve been thinking about something,” I said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What?” He asked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I paused, nodding at the archaeological find beside my sleeping bag. “This steel panel is crumpled and battered.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They had a nasty storm up here,” Amir said. “Bad weather is common in the Bavarian Alps.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This German fortress is buried beneath snow. It’s built into the mountain. I don’t think a storm dislodged the panel, Amir,” I said. “Did somebody remove it, perhaps? We might not be the first people to find the shelter.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You need to stop worrying about that,” My colleague said. “Nobody’s beaten us.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We should find out,” I said, already slipping into my gear. “I certainly won’t be able to sleep now.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amir groaned, before nodding and getting dressed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Torches at the ready, we stepped into the frozen world of Zugspitze, utterly alone in the darkness. No hope of sunlight to guide us for another three or four hours. And I knew Amir was right. We should’ve waited. But I’d been doing that for years. And it had cost me so many opportunities. I wasn’t going to make that mistake again, as reckless as that may sound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Living was more important than surviving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You pointed out that the panel looked like it may have housed ventilation slats,” I said. “The crumpled metal did have that vague shape.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sure,” Amir shrugged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So, if it has broken free, that might be another access point to the fortress,” I pointed out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But this bunker might be humongous. The ventilation system could be anywhere. You’re not seriously planning on doing more digging at this hour, are you?” He asked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As I said, the panel has already broken free — either Mother Nature or another person has already done the digging for us,” I said. “Come on. Let’s look around.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Bear in mind that 48 hours of fresh snowfall will have likely covered whatever was uncovered,” Amir noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I know,” I said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thirty yards to the side of the tent, there stood a flag — it marked the spot at which the panel had been found. Our starting point for the excavation. The small pole and its flapping fabric were both wearing thick, snowy blankets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What are you hoping to find?” Amir asked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Think about it,” I said. “A ventilation system missing its slats. That might provide another access point to the bunker.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Wait,” Amir said, pointing at a protruding rock-face thirty yards up the slope. “See that?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I squinted through the snowfall and saw what Amir had spotted. Streaks of red dyed the snow across the limestone face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I shuddered. “Is that…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Blood,” Amir coldly finished. “I was wrong about that animal… It isn’t harmless. We should head to the town.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I shook my head. “I won’t stop now.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My friend groaned. “Don’t be stupid, Danica. You’re not going to follow that trail.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I’d already started wading through the snow, lighting the way with my torch once I passed beyond the reach of the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For crying out… Danica, you know I’m going to have to follow you,” Amir grunted, trudging after me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to come with me,” I said. “I just need to see this place before anyone else, Amir. This is our discovery.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But my colleague ran after me, and we battled against the wilful breeze. The bloody trail continued for a hundred yards, painting a terrible, wavy line across the snow-covered wall. It stopped at a hole in the rock-face — a cavernous hole of twisted metal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I was right…” I gasped. “This structure is bigger than we ever imagined.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t know how I feel about this,” Amir said. “We should wait for Enzo and the others. It’ll be daytime when they arrive.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m not going to make you follow me,” I said. “I feel guilty enough for asking you to camp on this freezing mountain.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Look, if… If somebody has removed that ventilation panel, then…” Amir sighed. “We’ve already been beaten to this discovery, Danica. It’s over. I’m sorry.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I shook my head, shivering. “The metal is bending towards us, Amir. Whatever removed the panel, it did so from &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the vent.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I shone my torch’s light into the blackened pit, revealing a rusted ventilation shaft. A metal tunnel that veered quickly to the left. The entrance to the tunnel was partially filled with fresh snowfall. I stepped inside, surprised by the width and height of the vent. I crouched slightly, but it was a broad passageway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Danny, please,” Amir begged, grabbing my arm. “Don’t do this… The blood is–”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“– Something’s in there,” I interrupted, gently removing his hand. “Go back to the tent, Amir. Call Enzo. But I’m not going back until I’ve seen the fortress with my own eyes. This is going to be the biggest discovery in archaeological history.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amir did not turn around, however. He begrudgingly followed me into the ventilation shaft. Our boots squelched in the snow, and then came the squelch of whatever maroon-coloured gunk lay at our feet — most likely blood, but it was mixed with something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t like this,” Amir whispered, his voice echoing around the ceaseless metal chamber. “The stench is unbearable.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“At least it masks your body odour,” I quipped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m not in the mood, Danny,” Amir said. “This all feels–”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“– Oh my…” I gasped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stopping in my tracks, I looked down at the gaping hole in the floor of the vent. The hole which would’ve claimed me if I’d taken another step. When Amir and I pointed our torches at it, we saw a small bedroom. The quarters of long-gone soldiers. Inside, there were two bunk beds, barely held together by rotting wood, and covered with maggot-ridden mattresses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The horror of our discovery finally filled my bones, paralysing my spine. And Amir saw that in my stiff, unmoving body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You’ve seen the bunker. We were first. We should head back now,” He pleaded. “This isn’t right.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“No human made that hole,” I said. “No animal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Even less of a reason to go down there,” Amir insisted. “I’m begging you, Danny. We need to leave. Now. Before we find that… thing you saw.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What escaped this place?” I asked, shivering. “I have to know, Amir.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Danny!” My friend protested as I slipped my torch into my pocket. “Don’t do it…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Help me,” I said as I sat and dangled my legs into the opening of the vent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I won’t,” He said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Well, it’s going to hurt when I hit the floor,” I shrugged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My colleague sighed, seeing that I wasn’t bluffing, and he placed his torch onto the floor, lighting the tunnel. Then he held my arms tightly as I gingerly slid over the edge of the hole. I felt like a child daring to dip a toe out of her duvet, in spite of the monsters beneath the bed. I placed one foot on the top bunk and lowered my second leg delicately. In a swift movement, I broke free from Amir’s grip.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I screamed as the mattress and supporting wooden planks collapsed under my weight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Danny!” Amir cried.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My friend collected his torch and swiftly jumped into the hole, landing with a resounding thunk. As I hazily sat upright, lost in a festering mound of rotten wood and filthy cotton, I noticed Amir hobbling towards me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Are you okay?” He grimaced, helping me to my feet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m fine,” I groaned. “Are you?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think I might’ve twisted my ankle,” My friend said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I winced. “I’m sorry, Amir. This was… You were right. This was way too dangerous. Come on. Let’s get you back to camp.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He shook his head. “I’m strong enough to lift you back up, but you’re not going to be able to lift me. No offence.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But you need help. What if you’ve broken something?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s not a lot that could be done now,” Amir sighed. “This is why I said we should wait until the morning.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I know,” I said, hugging the man tightly. “I’m sorry. Have I mentioned that?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yes, but not enough times,” He smiled. “Still, you were right. This… This place is real. And it’s unbelievable. Your favourite word.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Are you going to keep saying that?” I chuckled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Take the win,” He said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Okay,” I replied, smiling weakly. “I told you so.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Are you going to keep saying that?” He asked, grinning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For a moment, we forgot about the sounds we’d heard on the mountain. The blood in the snow. The black shape I’d seen in the distance. None of those things mattered. Amir and I were explorers again. Blind to danger. Jubilant about our astounding discovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Anyway, the best option would be to lift you into the vent,” Amir said. “You should fetch Enzo, then come back here.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Look at this,” I said, ignoring my friend. “A journal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a small cabinet at the end of the demolished bunk bed, there sat a dusty, leather-bound book. I blew off the cobwebs and flicked away a persistent spider. The diary was written in German, of course, but I’m fluent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Diary of Conrad Vogel,” I translated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s great, Danny,” Amir said. “Now, come over here so I can lift you up.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Okay,” I sighed, pocketing the journal. “I’ll rush back to camp and phone Enzo. We’ll get you out of here.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He’s going to be pissed,” Amir warned, preparing his hands to lift me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I shrugged, climbing onto Amir’s sturdy palms. “He’s always pissed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This time, he’ll be royally pissed,” He grunted, raising me through the hole.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Everything will be fine, worrywart,” I said, climbing into the ventilation shaft. “I’ll hurry back. Don’t go anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Funny,” Amir said. “Don’t mind me. I’ll just have a nap on this crusty mattress.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hurried through the vent and emerged into the blizzard, which felt merciless after being sheltered by a castle of steel and concrete. I fought against the elements, wading back to the campsite. Once inside the tent, I immediately used the satellite phone to contact Enzo — my mobile wasn’t receiving any signal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s half four in the morning,” The man muttered from the receiver. “Why have you woken me, Miss Craven?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath, preparing for a lecture. “Amir and I… found something.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What do you mean?” The man growled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We heard footsteps, and then we found a trail of blood…” I started.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enzo paused. “There shouldn’t be any wild animals on the mountain. Certainly not in this weather.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t a wild animal, Mr Flores,” I said. “The blood led to a ventilation shaft… It’s another way of accessing the fortress.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“YOU…” Enzo barked, before composing himself. “You explored an uncharted, century-old building without supervision at night. Is that what you mean to tell me?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Well, I… We had a little… accident,” I gulped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I felt Enzo’s rage through the phone. “What happened, Miss Craven?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Amir injured his ankle,” I whispered timidly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“WHAT?” Enzo roared. “Where is he now?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In the bunker,” I said. “I came back to the campsite to ask you for help. We have to get him out of there.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Stay where you are,” The man growled. “Do not go anywhere without us.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The phone fell silent, and I had nothing to do but sit and wait. It would take an hour for Enzo to reach me, at the very least. And I didn’t want to cause any more problems. But then I excitedly remembered what lay in my coat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I scooped the diary of Conrad Vogel out of my pocket.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;January 2nd, 1948&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It has been nearly three years since we won the war. Commander Meyer, however, insists that the surface remains unsafe. The Führer has claimed the world, but roaches remain, of course. A resistance that seeks to squash us. Bavaria is at war. That is why we must stay hidden until German forces have come to save us. Hidden in the Tollerberg. Our Führer’s mightiest stronghold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have doubts, but I will never voice them aloud. Even writing such things will put my life at risk, but I must pen my thoughts. I am losing my mind. I cannot bottle up these feelings any longer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corporal Fischer died today. I had the privilege of clearing his room. And I found this empty journal in his belongings. Strange that he would never use it. It’s a sign. God longs for me to do something more than fester in this shithole.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, let me get this off my chest. There are two possible truths:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The war continues, or we have lost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But we have not won. Why would we still be hiding down here?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;February 27th, 1948&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s harder to keep up with a diary than I thought. Even with nothing to do down here, the mind wanders. Wanders to strange places.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the crop rooms failed last week. I don’t know why. Tollerberg is full of advanced technology. Things beyond my understanding. But we’ve got dozens of crop rooms. We’ll be okay. I don’t really care as long as I get fed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But I feel the nearing tide of dissent. People are angry and afraid. And it is not good to be with scared men in a cage. Sure, we have an abundance of food, but how long are we going to stay down here? What happens when more crop rooms fail? At some point, we won’t have enough to feed everybody.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I vote that we stop feeding the prisoners. I don’t share the ideals of our Führer, though it is treason to say so. Nonetheless, I hate the British and the French. Let them starve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commander Meyer told us the crop rooms wouldn’t fail. He told us this fortress would stand for a thousand years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So many lies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;March 12th, 1948&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another crop room failed. That’s two in two months. Nobody’s going hungry yet, but the murmuring is getting louder. I don&amp;#39;t like the thought of an underground mutiny.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not much else to report. Charlotte and I have been meeting in my room when my bunkmates are away. She is a terrible nurse, but an excellent lover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;August 15th, 1948&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some privates left Tollerberg yesterday. Cowards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I do not know why we are cowering down here. I do not believe in the Führer’s cause. But I know that I love my country. I will never leave the Tollerberg. I will never betray Germany.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;December 25th, 1948&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first Christmas I have celebrated in ten years. Commander Meyer senses the furious sentiment of the people. To quell our dangerous thoughts, he has allowed us to honour our Christian traditions. The Führer would not approve. But he isn’t here, is he?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think he might be dead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;June 21st, 1951&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I forgot about this old thing. Life intervened. Death intervened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So many crop rooms have failed over the past three years. And, as I predicted, rations have commenced. So much for Tollerberg lasting a thousand years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many have rioted, faced execution, and become martyrs for future revolutions. Perpetuating an endless cycle of death. Riot. Die. Riot. Die.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We despise the prisoners. More mouths to feed. Enemy mouths. But Commander Meyer tells us that ‘a prisoner equals power’. Why do we need hostages? To me, that is not the statement of a winning side. But I’ve known that for years. The war is over.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;December 1st, 1951&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The men are falling sick. The women too, though they have been prioritised.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is the starving who suffer the greatest. Fortunately, we have begun to prioritise Germans when it comes to food. Most of the prisoners are ill. They’re starving and living in dire conditions. But Commander Meyer finally values self-preservation over power.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, he’s starting to lose his grip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;March 12th, 1952&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Klein says that many of the sick are infected with tuberculosis. They have caught the White Death. An old disease. There was talk of a cure for it towards the end of the war. Though such a thing may exist, it doesn’t exist down here. And the sick are only getting sicker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are trapped in a tin can.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;March 30th, 1952&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sick have been confined to the west quarter. The armoury. There is one section for German patients and a separate section for prisoners. We will quarantine them there until they die. They have been left with adequate provisions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All I keep thinking is that there will be fewer mouths to feed. And I am glad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;July 10th, 1954&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Much has changed in two years. I found this book whilst clearing my bunkmate’s belongings — I stashed it under his mattress. He would never think to look there. Not that it matters now. His name was Berhtram, and he caught the White Death. No matter how many times we quarantine the sick, the disease always returns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Klein has been conducting tests. Trying to find a cure. He grows tired of begging Commander Meyer to let us leave the Tollerberg. Like me, he surely knows that there is no war. He knows that we lost. But he would not dare leave this place of his own accord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t think anybody really leaves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;November 2nd, 1955&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have a reason to unearth this journal once more. Charlotte has given birth to our child.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of only twenty children born in the fourteen years we have spent in this bunker. I have named him Fritz Vogel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I fear for the boy’s life. I pray that Commander Meyer succumbs to old age in the near future. He seems to be the last thread holding this place together. After him, we may even leave this place. Few people believe in the cause of the Führer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;November 16th, 1956&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each year passes in the blink of an eye. One might expect time to drag in such a place. No. Time does not exist here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fritz is the only thing keeping Charlotte and me going. But we are lucky. We have more than most. And for that, we are grateful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our population dwindles. Ten years ago, there were a thousand of us in this underground city. Six-hundred people remain. The White Death ebbs and flows. Whenever we think it has disappeared, it claims another dozen lives or so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But Doctor Klein promises that he is close to a solution. He conducts tests only on the prisoners. That is what he says, anyway. I only fear that his tests continue to put all of us at risk. We shouldn’t be keeping the sick alive. Put bullets in their heads. Eliminate the risk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctors think too much. Life is not that complicated. Klein will kill us all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;May 7th, 1961&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It seems I uncover this journal at milestones in my life. And this will be my final one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The White Death has finally caught me. I have requested that I be killed tonight. Killed and cremated. I don’t want to be another one of Klein’s experiments. I don’t trust that he only experiments on the prisoners. The ageing man has claimed for the past seven years to be on the verge of a breakthrough. All I see is a pile of bodies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I only hope I have not passed this terrible affliction to Charlotte or Fritz. I am not a good man, but they are pure people. Charlotte is a woman of conviction. She doesn’t want to be here. She cares only for healing people, as terrible as she may be at doing so. And Fritz is a gentle soul. He doesn’t deserve this life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I pray this place does not eat him alive in my absence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shuddering at the German soldier’s last entry, I turned the page to find a fresh entry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Diary of Fritz Vogel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;October 27th, 1973&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My name is Fritz, and I don’t know whether anyone will ever read my father’s diary. They will likely never read my logs either.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I found my father’s book whilst packing my things and moving to a new room in the south wing. Mother is sad to see me go, and I’m scared too. But I’m eighteen now, and I knew this day would come. Commander Meyer insists that all men become soldiers. All women become nurses or teachers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It seems meaningless. So few of us remain. And I have found it baffling to read my father’s account of this place. Stranger still to imagine a world outside of Tollerberg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Father talked of one thousand people living in this place. Well, more than thirty years later, there are five-hundred of us. And the White Death still lingers, but it’s not the threat it used to be. Of course, we lose people every year. And there aren’t many children. There aren’t many people left to have children.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;September 8th, 1974&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I only remember this book when I feel that my feelings might finally bubble over. My father was right. Writing is the only thing that extinguishes the insanity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve been working with Cuckoo Klein in the laboratory. That is what my friends call him, but he doesn’t seem that bad to me. Perhaps I focus too much on my father’s journal entries. He talked of a determined, intelligent doctor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That being said, the old man I see is, admittedly, a little lost. I have been told he still experiments on the prisoners in the abandoned west wing. But they all died long ago. As Commander Meyer said, the war is over. There’s no need to waste precious resources on the enemy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He’s a very different man from the one Father described. Of course, he’s getting old too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;February 16th, 1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was excited to work in the lab. It was better than other soldierly duties. Patrols. Guarding the old armoury in the west wing. Cleaning toilets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But I’m starting to agree with my friends. Doctor Klein makes me uncomfortable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You are sick,” He tells me. “But I keep you healthy.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lina tells me that he often says the same to her. She keeps me from losing my head.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;December 2nd, 1976&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mother passed. She caught the White Death.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Klein told me that the old ones don’t have what it takes. Not like the young blood. The post-war babies. I don’t think he should have said that to me. Commander Meyer still tells the obvious lie that the war rages onwards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve asked Commander Meyer to assign me to a different department. It took all of my willpower not to thump the doctor in the face for his callous comments following my mother’s death.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;November 19th, 1989&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thirteen years have passed. A lifetime, in many ways. But life is just as gruelling as I remember.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still, it seemed fitting to return to this diary at a momentous juncture of my life. Much has changed in Tollerberg.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am Colonel Fritz Vogel. I work as Commander Braun’s right-hand man. Not that we have many people left to lead. One-hundred people live in Tollerberg. Father often talked of revolutions and escapees, but we do not fear that. All survivors are either too old to leave or too young to know any other life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Braun and I have discussed it before. Making the call to leave this place. But what lies beyond the fortress? A world that does not belong to the Führer. The Führer is dead. That was what Commander Meyer revealed to us on his death bed. A secret we must keep. I have not even told my wife, Lina.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We lost the war in 1945. Ten years before I was even born. And this stronghold is the home of the Führer’s last men and women. The commander was a selfish man. When he learnt that Germany had lost the war, he told nobody in Tollerberg. He continued the lie. Told folk to remain strong and patient.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After all, this castle was built to last. Indoor crop fields, water drawn from the snow on the mountain, and a thousand other advanced machines that made this the perfect haven. A home for a millennium.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The commander told us that we were finally free to leave. He wouldn’t stop us. But where would we go? This is the only home the children have ever known. If we were to step foot into the outside world, it would reject us. And that is not the only secret Commander Meyer revealed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The prisoners and their descendents are still alive in the armoury.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For thirty-five years, Doctor Klein has been conducting experiments on them. The rumours were true. He’s still trying to cure the White Death. And though he has not succeeded, he has developed a treatment. A treatment that he has been giving to children for decades. That’s why we haven’t been getting sick. He gives every newborn baby a ‘temporary’ vaccine, and then he slips treatments into our food.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It only works on the young. Something about the vaccine only working on young flesh. It kills the old.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctor Klein must be the luckiest man on Earth to have worked so closely with infected patients for nearly four decades without becoming sick himself. The man has to be in his eighties.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;August 31st, 1992&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lina and I have just welcomed our baby girl to the world. Ella. The third generation of the Vogel family to live in this godforsaken place. Still, that is nothing short of a miracle in these times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are seventy-two survivors. Most of the old guard has perished. However, against all odds, Doctor Klein persists. He must be the oldest man in the bunker by a country mile. I imagine he has a picture of Dorian Gray stashed somewhere in his room.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;April 5th, 1995&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You must see my work.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The doctor said that to me today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He has been trying to show me the armoury in the west wing for years. I have refused. Commander Braun saw something in there. Something that made him sick in the head. He took his life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We have no commander now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don’t want to face the same fate. Klein has told me more than I wanted to hear. It’s horrible enough to know that those poor prisoners of war are still alive. Prisoners of a war that ended fifty years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lina and I don’t believe in any of this. We don’t believe in the things that the Führer said. The idea of a perfect race. What does that even mean? I don’t want to know what things he did. But based on stories from the old folk, we were on the wrong side of history. They wouldn’t say that, of course.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are fewer people to keep things running. Fewer people who know how to fix machinery and grow crops. After Commander Braun died, I disbanded the patrols. This is no army. It’s a group of scared people hiding underground. Too afraid of the world lying beyond the door.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Worst of all, the White Death has returned.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;December 21st, 1996&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I finally succumbed to the doctor’s demands. I joined him in the old armoury.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the past year, old age and the White Death have both killed every member of the old guard, other than Doctor Klein. There are roughly fifty people living in this hole. Most survivors are under the age of forty. None of us know of the world before the bunker. None of us know of the world beyond the bunker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before we die, I had to know what the doctor was doing. And it was far worse than anything I could’ve possibly imagined.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The surviving prisoners are the children and grandchildren of the English and French prisoners. They have known no life beyond the west wing. Beyond their cages. But that wasn’t what horrified me the most. The German ward of the armoury is empty. No sick have survived in there. But in the prison ward, Klein introduced me to cages of children.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They were bloated beyond breaking point. Gargantuan, bulging people. Not just their bellies, but their limbs and faces. Their skin was green and swollen, as if their entire bodies had developed gangrene.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The doctor ignored my disturbed reaction. He began to taunt the children. Spitting in their cage. Calling them vile, sickening names. Telling them that God had punished them for their sins. The very sin of being born in the cases of the Jewish prisoners. My father was a man of God, and that didn’t sound right to me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The children said nothing in response. Just surveyed us with agonised, glassy eyes. Eyes that seemed to beg me for death. Before I even knew what I was doing, I drew my father’s ancient revolver and unloaded all six rounds into the doctor’s back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He did not die immediately. Not like a normal man. But then Doctor Klein was not really a man anymore. Who knows what experiments he conducted to prolong his life? And as I stood over the doctor, who smiled with blood pooling in his lips, he told me a terrible secret.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He found the cure for the White Death before I was even born. A cure that he administered to the young folk before we were born. But the side effects could be seen in the cages. The green and blackened children. Doctor Klein told me that he found a way to stop the disease from killing us by binding our minds with the bacteria. Fusing us into a singular entity. The host keeps the disease alive, and the disease keeps the host alive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But that is no kind of life. What happened to those children is not human.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He’d been putting treatments in the food of the German children not to fight the disease, but to stop the cure from turning us into monsters like the prisoners. And as Doctor Klein died at my feet, I realised something terrible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without him, there will be no more treatments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As my heart raced, I turned the page to find nothing but manic scribbles. Scribbles that continued over the course of numerous pages. The occasional word or phrase was easily discernible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heat… Warmth… Eat heat…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not that it made sense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My heart raced as I thought about the dark shape I’d seen outside the tent. The looming shadow with ginormous footsteps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One or more of the Tollerberg residents had survived.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Amir…” I whispered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle&quot;&gt;fearfully&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Theeaglestrikes&quot;&gt; /u/Theeaglestrikes &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1yi85/in_2023_we_found_a_wwii_fortress_in_a_german/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1yi85/in_2023_we_found_a_wwii_fortress_in_a_german/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c1yi85</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1yi85/in_2023_we_found_a_wwii_fortress_in_a_german/" /><updated>2024-04-12T03:01:15+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-12T03:01:15+00:00</published><title>In 2023, we found a WWII fortress in a German mountain.

My wife was seven months pregnant at the time with our daughter and had begun to struggle sleeping. On certain nights where she couldn&amp;#39;t get comfortable I would sleep on the futon so she could have enough space to roll to either side or flail her arms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, I had just finished making the futon and was shutting off the TV when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. It was gone so quickly that I wasn&amp;#39;t even certain I had really see anything, but it was almost seemed like a solid shadow in the middle of the kitchen. I just blinked and didn&amp;#39;t think much of it at the time, but the next morning I woke up with a small amount of dried blood around the corners of the fingernails on my right hand. Very little of it, dried and flaking. So little that it almost seemed like I&amp;#39;d tried to wash it away in the evening. I didn&amp;#39;t remember getting up from sleep before morning, and I didn&amp;#39;t have any cuts or scratches on myself. Concerning, sure, but it was so minimal that I assumed at the time I just hadn&amp;#39;t cleaned well enough after making dinner the night before. I&amp;#39;d made grilled chicken and a roasted vegetable mix that included beets, and they stain everything they touch a purple-red. So I blamed the beets and went on with my life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nothing unusual happened again for another two months. But only a couple weeks before our daughter was born it happened again. I saw something like a shadow moving on its own in my periphery while out for a smoke. Like before, I assumed my eyes to be playing tricks on me. However, when I woke up the next morning with dried blood under my fingernails? Yeah, then I was genuinely worried something was wrong with me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never had the best memory. Plenty of things that would be important to your average joe slip right through my consciousness. I&amp;#39;d never had blackouts or memory loss as far as I was aware though. I decided to call my mother and ask her if I&amp;#39;d ever had sleepwalking episodes when I was a kid, just to put my mind at ease. She told me I&amp;#39;d never had anything of the sort. I don&amp;#39;t know what spurred it on in the moment, but I decided to just tell her honestly about why I was concerned. The too-long silence on the other end of the line gave me more answers than her feigned response of &amp;quot;Oh honey, you&amp;#39;ve got a lot on your shoulders right now, I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;re just overthinking things.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The morning after I had called my mom I got up and walked to the bathroom to brush my teeth. I&amp;#39;d woken up with a nasty taste in my mouth, but that can happen when you&amp;#39;re a heavy smoker. Once again it didn&amp;#39;t seem unusual to me. When I went to rinse my mouth out, I spat crimson. I gasped in shock and opened my mouth. My teeth were stained red as marrow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I called my mother again in a panic, not daring to tell my wife. I didn&amp;#39;t want her to think I was losing it while we had a baby on the way. She had enough to handle herself without needing to worry that her husband was possibly possessed. But when my mother picked up the phone, I very quickly realized something was horribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ma, I woke up with blood in my mouth, and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s mine. What weren&amp;#39;t you telling me yesterday? Don&amp;#39;t act like you didn&amp;#39;t try to brush it off when I asked. I&amp;#39;m certain some weird shit is up. Just tell me what&amp;#39;s going on with me if you know, please.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She sighed, and the sound of that alone nearly sent me into a panic attack. She sounded almost... elated. And her voice carried with it a venomous tone I&amp;#39;d never heard. It was like a serpent hidden under her skin hissing through human lips.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sweetie, if you were hungry it&amp;#39;s only natural to find something to eat.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hung up the phone and turned to vomit into my kitchen sink. Chunks of partially digested meat and skin mixed with bile clogged the drain. Attached to one larger chunk was a gold hoop. It was a septum piercing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t talked to my mother since. My wife asked for months why I wouldn&amp;#39;t let Mom visit our daughter, but she knows enough now to understand it&amp;#39;s for the best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think the shadows I was seeing were almost like a preemptive phantasm. A ghostlike imprint on reality before I slaughtered someone. If my current count is correct, I&amp;#39;m up to sixteen now. It happens every few weeks, no longer than six weeks so far between... incidents. I even tried cuffing myself to the bed by one hand every night for three weeks, until I woke up one morning with a dislocated thumb and the usual bloodstains. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today though, I woke up drenched in gore. There was a note from my wife stuck to the closet door that simply read &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s too much now. I love you but don&amp;#39;t look for us. I don&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;ll do anymore.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The partially devoured body of a guy who looked to be in his early 20&amp;#39;s was propped up at the kitchen table, his severed left arm still on a cutting board. I&amp;#39;d ripped several bites out of his cheek, took both ears off, and had eaten his right eye. His phantom was standing behind the body, boring a hole through me with empty eye sockets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sitting at a quiet, isolated, and deep lake near my town right now as I finish writing this. There&amp;#39;s two cinderblocks and rope next to me. My wife was right, it&amp;#39;s too much now. I don&amp;#39;t even want to consider how many people my mother has had for dinner. I&amp;#39;m going to take a nice final swim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take my advice, if you wake up with blood under your nails or in your mouth, don&amp;#39;t ask why and try to live on in ignorance. Your nocturnal excisions are between you, the devil, and that body you&amp;#39;re currently digesting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hope my wife feeds my daughter well enough before she puts her to bed every night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/UponThisAltar&quot;&gt; /u/UponThisAltar &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1ypcg/nocturnal_excisions/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1ypcg/nocturnal_excisions/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c1ypcg</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1ypcg/nocturnal_excisions/" /><updated>2024-04-12T03:11:02+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-12T03:11:02+00:00</published><title>Nocturnal Excisions</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/Gingerlox_</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/Gingerlox_</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a receptionist at a hotel. I can’t tell you which one because as much as I hate my job right now, I really can’t afford to get fired. Let’s just say it’s a chain in the UK, it rhymes with GravelSlodge, and it’s pretty gross. Like, we’re talking powdered egg for breakfast and vomit stains on the carpet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I work nights, so I’ve seen my fair share of fucked up stuff. There’s the woman who took a shit on the floor, picked it up, put it in her purse, and carried on about her evening like nothing had happened. Or the time a man ran around naked, arms flailing, screaming “the sheep are coming”. And that’s just a standard Friday night. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Honestly, I have hundreds of tales like that to tell. But this one is different. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay, so I’m going to set the scene for you: it’s a Sunday night, so it’s pretty slow. It’s about 11pm- I’m a few hours into my shift. There’s one other dude, Greg, working the front desk with me, but he’s disappeared to help someone with their key card. I’m doom scrolling on my phone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hola!” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I look up and there’s this elderly woman with long black hair standing in front of the reception desk grinning at me. She couldn’t have been any younger than 75, but her face was absolutely plastered in make-up. I’m talking chalk white foundation, thick black eyeliner, and bright red lipstick to compliment her yellow teeth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Oh!” I say, tucking my phone back in my pocket. “Sorry. How can I help?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A room.” She giggles, spit flying out of her mouth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Of course. Single or double?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She bursts out laughing, like I’d said the funniest fucking thing on the planet. A vein protrudes on her forehead as she cackles harder and harder. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I start laughing myself, taken aback by her reaction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then she just stops. Becomes silent for a few seconds, staring at me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Uh… okay.” I say, smiling awkwardly. “So single or double?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The cheapest room you have.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I book her in, take payment, hand her a key card, and send her on her way. When Greg returns, I tell him about it and we have a laugh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Shit, man.” He says. “You really do get some sorts, don’t you?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An hour later I get a call from make-up lady. I’m not gonna use her real name, so let’s call her Doris. Anyway, Doris gives me a buzz. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Front desk, Max speaking.” I say. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hello, it’s Doris calling from room 67.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hello Doris, how can I help?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Do you have cameras in the rooms?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not the first time I’ve been asked this, so I’m not really phased by the question. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Not in the bedrooms,” I say. “But we do in all the public areas like the hallways, reception area, dining area….“&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She hangs up. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay… I think. Bit weird. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I get back to my doom scrolling and a little while later Greg informs me he’s popping out for a quick smoke. So I’m alone again, sitting at the desk, minding my own business.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then I hear it. It almost sounds like someone blowing bubblegum. You know that annoying popping noise? I look around, but don’t see anything, so turn my attention back to my phone, trying to ignore it. The noise carries on for several minutes and in the end it’s getting on my nerves so much so that I stand up and walk around the desk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I nearly jump out of my skin. Doris is crouched down on the floor, clicking her tongue against the roof of her mouth. I stare at her in shock, and she clicks again. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Are you okay?” I say, eventually. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Click. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, I start to feel uncomfortable. Like I said before, I’ve seen some weird shit, and I’m relatively used to it. But there was just something about this woman that rubbed me the wrong way. Her bulging eyes and clown-like make-up combined together with her bony body and odd behaviour made me want to run and hide. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Is there anything I can do for you?” I ask her. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suddenly, she jumps up. She cranes her neck towards the ceiling, staring at one of our security cameras. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She looks back at me and gives me the weirdest smile. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You’re watching me.” she says, wagging a finger in my face. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“…uh, what?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her smile vanishes and for a brief moment she looks furious. Then she turns and walks away. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It was so fucking weird!” I say to Greg when he gets back. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He laughs again, but less convincingly this time. Greg’s a bit younger than me, so realising I might have spooked him a bit, I try to play it down. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think she’s lost her marbles.” I say. “I’m sure she’s harmless.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About half an hour later I get a call from Doris again. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What can I do for you this time?” I ask.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Can you see me?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My heart flutters a bit and I look around. She’s calling from her room though, so there’s no way I’d be able to see her. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“No.” I reply. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Look harder.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t know why, but I play along. I scan the hotel again, and even take another quick peek behind the desk. I don’t see her. I just see the dark and empty dining area, the main entrance leading to the car park, and a long empty corridor. No Doris. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Nope,” I say, trying to hide the fear in my voice. “Don’t see you. Is there anything I can do for you?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She hangs up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hey, Greg.” I say, and he walks over. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s up?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I pause for a moment, wondering if I should actually tell him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Uh.. can you cover me for a sec?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I go outside for a smoke, bumping into Tokes. Tokes is one of the security guards and by far the most intimating looking person I’ve ever seen. He’s 6”4, bald, covered in tats, and can smoke a whole cigarette in two tokes, hence the nickname. Despite his appearance, Tokes has an absolutely winning personality. He’s one of the funniest and friendliest guys ever, so it’s no surprise that I got carried away chatting to him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About twenty minutes later I remember I’m meant to be working. I bid farewell to Tokes and head back inside. As I walk through the main entrance I see Greg standing behind the front desk. He looks rough. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You alright?” I ask him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He shakes his head. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s up?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m really sorry, Max.” he says. “I hate to do this to you but I think I need to leave. I don’t feel good.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Oh, shit. Yeah, no dramas. I’ve got things covered.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He nods. His skin is white and clammy, and he really doesn’t seem right, so I know he’s not faking. But something about his expression told me he wasn’t being 100% honest with me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Greg… did something happen?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I just really don’t feel good, I’ve got to go.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He grabs his things and scurries off, apologising again before heading out the door. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then the phone rings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Front desk, Max speaking.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s just you and me now.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My blood runs cold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Pardon?” I say. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s a short pause followed by that god awful clicking noise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Can you see me?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“No, I can’t.” I say, trying to sound stern. “Please stop calling unless you need help with something. I’m busy.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hang up. I realise I’m slightly out of breath, and wonder why I’m getting so worked up over a batty old lady. I turn around to look at the security screens just in case. Nothing out of the ordinary. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The phone rings again. I pick up, getting pissed off now. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You’re getting warmer…” says Doris, in a sing-song voice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Look, lady. There is literally no way I can see you.” I say to her. “You’re calling from your room, a place with no cameras. Please stop wasting my-” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I stare at the screen. There, in a box in the top hand corner, is Doris. She’s standing at the end of a corridor, smiling up at the camera. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What the f-“&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She gives me a slow wave, and starts laughing down the phone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Looks like you found me.” She says, but her lips don’t move on the screen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“How are you doing that?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“How am I doing that?” she says, and again, her lips don’t move. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I watch her creep closer to the camera. It’s like she’s staring right at me, bearing all of her yellow teeth in a disgustingly large grin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t make sense, and I feel the panic rise up in my chest. I slam down the phone, my body shaking. Suddenly, I feel extremely vulnerable. Like I’m being watched. I have an overwhelming urge to turn around, but I don’t. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, I give Tokes a call, asking him to come to reception. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He arrives only minutes later, but those were the longest few minutes of my life. With every second that went by, I felt colder and clammier. I felt eyes on me, but all I could do was sit frozen in my chair, staring at nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s up, big guy?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His voice makes me jump. I look up at him, unable to speak. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Woah. You look like fried shit. Are you alright?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I glance back at the security screens. I’m relieved to see Doris isn’t there. I try to compose myself a bit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Can you check room 67 for me?” I ask. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Of course. What’s the problem?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t want to say too much because I’m beginning to doubt my own sanity at this point, so I simplify things a bit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s this woman in there and she keeps calling the front desk. Not with any problems, she’s just being a nuisance. Could you maybe give her a warning?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sure.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I almost tell him to be careful, but I stop myself. It’s late, I’m tired.. maybe my mind is playing tricks on me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Cheers.” I say, and he walks off. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I turn my attention back to the security cameras, watching Tokes walk across several different boxes on the screens as he makes his way to Doris’ room. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He knocks on the door. Nothing. He gives it a second, then knocks again. The door opens a crack. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can’t see inside the room, but I can see Tokes talking. Nothing heated, just a normal conversation. About twenty seconds pass and the door shuts. Tokes turns around and looks up at the security camera. He gives me a thumbs up, and walks away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I sit back in my chair, exhaling sharply. Hopefully that’ll be it from Doris this evening. I reach into my pocket to pull out a cigarette and lighter, feeling like I’ve more than earnt another smoke break. But then something on the screen catches my eye. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s Tokes, standing at Doris’ door again, talking. I watch, wondering if it’s about to kick off. But then the door closes, and Tokes turns around, looking up at the security camera. He gives a thumbs up and walks away. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then he appears again, standing at the door. He knocks. Waits a second. Knocks again. Door opens. He talks. Door closes. He looks at the camera. Thumbs up. Walks away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It looks like it’s the same footage playing on repeat, but when I double check the time stamp at the top of the screen it’s running fine. It’s not a glitch, it’s not a malfunction. He’s just… stuck. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The phone rings. I want to cry. I don’t answer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I stare at the screen, watching Tokes do the exact same thing over and over again. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The phone is still ringing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He knocks. Waits. Knocks again. Door opens. He talks. Door closes. He looks at the camera. Thumbs up. Walks away. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My mouth feels dry from hanging open for so long. My jaw aches. My eyes are begging for moisture, yet I’m too terrified to blink. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He knocks. Waits. Knocks again. Door opens. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tokes carries on like he did before, completely oblivious to the horror in front of him. The door opens wider and wider. Tokes gives me a thumbs up, and walks away. The door is nearly all the way open now, but all I see is pitch black. Tokes knocks on nothing. He waits. Then knocks again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I notice her eyes first. Those bulging white spheres staring into my soul from the darkness. Then her smile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The phone is still ringing, it has been the whole time. My hand slowly reaches over to answer, despite my mind pleading it not to. I put the phone to my ear. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Did you tell on me?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What do you want?” I ask in a shaky voice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Click. Click. Click. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A high pitch ringing jolts through the phone, making my ear throb. I let out a cry, dropping the phone. I cover my ears with my hands and rock back and forth saying “no” over and over again. This is a fucking nightmare. I fell asleep on the job. None of this is real. It’s a dream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I scream when a hand touches my back. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Woah! Take it easy.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I spin around to see Tokes standing there, looking concerned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Tokes!!” I shout. I hug him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What the fuck, man?” he laughs, patting me on the back. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What happened to you?!” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What do you mean? I just spoke to the lady. She said she’s sorry, she’ll leave you alone.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We look at each other. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s all that happened?” I ask.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Uh, yeah. She literally just said ‘sorry to be a bother’ and ‘I’ll stop calling’. That’s it. Dude, are you alright? You’re acting weird.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I sit back, exhaling deeply. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yeah…” I say. “Yeah, I’m fine.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of my shift completely on edge, staring at that bastard phone waiting for it to ring. But it didn’t. For whatever reason, Doris kept her word and didn’t bother me again. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trust me when I say I’ve tried to think of a rational explanation for what I went through that night. I’ve spent many sleepless nights pondering it, over and over again, trying to make it make sense. But it doesn’t. None of it adds up. I couldn’t figure it out then, and I still can’t now. If anyone out there has any theories, then please.. I’m all ears. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh, and did I mention Greg quit? Yeah. He just never came back to work. I tried asking around to see if he said why but management didn’t really give me much information. Just said generic shit about “following a different path”, whatever that means. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But judging by the look I saw on his face that night, I know that in those twenty minutes he was by himself a certain someone gave him a call. Or perhaps paid him a visit. Something spooked him so bad that he never came back to GravelSlodge. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And honestly? I don’t fucking blame him. Not one &lt;a href=&quot;https://knightmarefuel.blogspot.com/?m=1&quot;&gt;bit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Gingerlox_&quot;&gt; /u/Gingerlox_ &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1my6j/gravelslodge/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1my6j/gravelslodge/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c1my6j</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1my6j/gravelslodge/" /><updated>2024-04-11T18:52:39+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-11T18:52:39+00:00</published><title>GravelSlodge</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/ByfelsDisciple</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/ByfelsDisciple</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I opened my trunk and pulled out two bottles of Kirkland Signature moonshine. With one hand free, I decided it was finally time to move the hatchet and extra twine from my car, because it had been a month since I picked up the extra firewood. I reached inside, felt something rubbery, and dropped the moonshine to the ground when I realized it was a blue human hand at room temperature. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most intense moments happen just like that, getting embedded into everyday life sans the fanfare a cinematographer would deem appropriate. I watched my brother chase a soccer ball into the street when we were in elementary school, and I stared in silent shock as the ensuing car accident ripped his leg off in a bloody mess. That level of triple-distilled fear burned through me now, grasping at my diaphragm and denying me the chance to breathe as I accepted the unchanging fact that at least part of a dead body had been residing in my trunk for an indeterminate amount of time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I dazedly picked up the moonshine from the asphalt. At least it came in sturdy plastic bottles. I unscrewed the cap, took a sip of liquid fire, and called 911.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Does the name Kelsey Rodriguez sound familiar to you?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I stopped dicing my beef and turned all my focus to the phone call. Nineteen attempts over the past thirteen hours had yielded nothing but voicemails, dead ends, and every other type of runaround from the Pasadena Police Department. I was shocked to finally get a detective, and was frothing at the mouth for answers. “Um – it’s familiar, I think…” My head spun even more than it had over the past day as I tried to organize my thoughts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“She exchanged several texts with you last Friday night. They were the final correspondence on her phone.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Oh yeah – the Tinder girl,” I mumbled as the scrambled memory finally organized itself in my head. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’ve IDed her as the woman in your trunk.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I leaned over and puked in the sink. After wiping my mouth with a trembling wrist, I tried to talk again. “What – what – why?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’d like to talk with you and see if we can piece together some answers.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My head felt like a merry-go-round. “Okay. I can come by the station-”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’ll send a car over to pick you up. Just sit tight and wait for us, Mr. White.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It happened again after the line went dead: all sensory input proceeded as normal, no matter how horrible I felt. I needed answers. So did the police. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s when it felt like a firework exploded in my head. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They were coming to pick me up. The guy who had a dead woman in his trunk. A woman he’d met on Tinder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We shared a &lt;em&gt;shit&lt;/em&gt;ton of DNA on Friday night. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world spun faster as I thought of the hatchet, twine, and alcohol I’d left in the trunk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was nearly knocked over by the sudden memory of Kelsey talking about her ex: “He’s extremely jealous. I think he follows me everywhere I go… He’s threatened to hurt me. He has access to a lot of information, because he’s a cop.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh, shit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had only seen that conversation as an opportunity to look protective, safe, and masculine. I guess it worked. Fuck. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I looked up to see a police car pulling up outside my house. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I looked down to see the bloody chef’s knife lying in a pool of beef blood. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I realized that I had been ten steps behind the whole time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I ran out the back door and didn’t stop. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve been hiding in a large park by the foothills ever since walking here. I’ll post this on my phone and then ditch my cell so they can’t track me, but I have to get this out first.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I swear that I’m innocent, but a corpse filled with semen doesn’t tell a sympathetic story. I don’t know how long I can hide from the police, and I don’t know what will happen when they finally catch up with me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because a few minutes ago, I found a Polaroid just behind a nearby tree. I didn’t want to look at it, but of course I did, and of course I regretted it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a shot of me with Kelsey, in my bed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It had been taken from outside my bedroom window. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I dropped it and ran, realizing afterward that I’d gotten my fingerprints on something that her ex has almost certainly recovered. I only stopped running when I got to the edge of the park and found a lone police car sitting in the corner. It looked like it had been there for some time. Waiting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t know how much longer I have. But there’s no way this ends well for me. Until then, I’ll keep running. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s amazing how long fear can keep us &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/&quot;&gt;going&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/ByfelsDisciple&quot;&gt; /u/ByfelsDisciple &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1cio1/whens_the_last_time_you_checked_the_hidden/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1cio1/whens_the_last_time_you_checked_the_hidden/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c1cio1</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1cio1/whens_the_last_time_you_checked_the_hidden/" /><updated>2024-04-11T11:18:46+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-11T11:18:46+00:00</published><title>When’s the last time you checked the hidden corners of your car?</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/emorybored</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/emorybored</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howdy, y’all. Welcome back to the shitshow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sorry it’s been…well. A while.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you checked the title before you clicked, that fairly well summarizes the focal point of our story today. If you can still remember anything from what was evidently a thousand fucking years back &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/118i7iq/i_work_at_the_night_library_i_think_im_finally/&quot;&gt;when I posted last&lt;/a&gt;, I said I’d gotten some intel on the weird donation with the creepy journals, etc. That’s where this installment comes in, and I fully intended to upload it just after the update on Doug. But then everything got real fucking weird. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buckle in. This one’s gonna be wild.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, a while ago (by which I mean who fucking knows how long ago now), it was just me, Sam, and Matt working: me in mending, Matt on the desk, Sam in the stacks. I can sorta-kinda see the front door from my not-office if I’m really looking, and for whatever reason, I happened to be doing so just as someone stepped inside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s just a vibe sometimes, about people’s intentions. The guy entering the library wasn’t in a uniform, but he was in a suit, and he looked unnervingly official. Very much like he meant business. Matt doesn’t like people who mean business, so I, purely on instinct, headed out to circ.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I knew he would, the man approached the desk. “Evenin’,” he said, nodding. That wasn’t good. Nobody nodded like that unless they meant real business.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Evenin’,” I echoed, because that was how he’d said it and because sometimes ‘g’s are too serious. “What can we do for you?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Well, gentlemen, let me introduce myself. My name is Brixby Leadingham. I’m a private investigator—” He paused here, extracting a badge from his pocket and holding it up for Matt and I to inspect. “—and I have reason to believe you may be in possession of some…artifacts. Would you mind if I took a look around?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I glanced at Matt. With a lowercase ‘g’, not an uppercase one, because ‘g’s are serious as it is, and because I was trying to be inconspicuous. He didn’t look like he was planning on opening his mouth anytime soon, so I said, “Sure!” probably a lot too enthusiastically. “Uh, can I ask what artifacts, exactly? Might be able to just point ‘em right out to you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The man looked around in a somewhat machiavellian manner, though I interpreted it as an overdramatization of checking his surroundings to be sure we were alone. “I’ve been on a particular individual’s trail for some time now. His current whereabouts are unknown, but the last security camera footage I was able to track down on him was right outside on the street, on his way into and out of this building. He had a bunch of boxes with him, and when he left, he was empty-handed. Sound familiar?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Uh…” I paused, genuinely considering. “We get a lot of donations, so I’m not totally sure I could pinpoint one person. Do you have any specifics?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He leaned in closer, voice dropping to a whisper that wafted warm, sugary breath over my face. “These wouldn’t have been ordinary donations. They’d have been of the…occult variety.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Oh,” I said, because fucking duh. “I know exactly who you’re talking about. We’ve got—here, just follow me.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I started to head out from behind the desk, but Matt full-on mom-armed me, physically halting me in my tracks before I could make it more than two steps. “I got it,” he told me. “You stay up here.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This time, I Glanced at him. Capital G. “O…kay?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He did not Glance (or even glance) back. Just walked around the counter, indicating that Brixby Leadingham, PI should accompany him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In case you were wondering: yes, I did, in fact, get instantaneous flashbacks to Matt marching upstairs after Sam and leaving me to wonder whether or not he’d ever come back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They were totally, completely unwarranted flashbacks, though. I knew that. Because Matt was just taking this guy to look through some stuff we’d had for probably two years, and we’d definitely already experienced the worst of it with the Ouija board fiasco. The most that could come of it was the rest of the shit that was brought in with it being taken off our hands. Straightforward enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Adam, you might ask, if everything was kosher, why wouldn’t Matt want you to take Brixby Leadingham, PI to the occult artifact donations?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah. Great fucking question. We’ll get there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, for a while, I was just hanging out. And then Sam finished shelving, so we were both just hanging out. Nobody was coming in, so we were mostly just taking turns seeing if we could flip rubber bands into the gap between two slightly askew ceiling tiles (a game Sam won by an absolute landslide, much to my chagrin). Once we’d lost enough of them to the abyss, though, we moved on to tidying up behind the desk (which Sam enjoyed to an unsettling degree), and then to taking turns reading each other whispered, dramatized passages of a stray harlequin romance we found lying on a cart. (Pro tip: if you ever come across an old enough, worn enough trade paperback romance at your own local library, hold the spine flat against the palm of your hand and let it fall open. The page it lands on will, at least seven times out of ten, be the filthiest one in the book, and if it is, it will one thousand times out of ten be the most hysterical thing you’ve ever read. You’re welcome.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, after a while, in the middle of a sentence about a Highlander stroking something or other (possibly just hair, but who really knows) Sam stopped and looked up, prompting me to also look up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Matt was back. Alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His hands were covered in blood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He just stood there for a moment and let them drip onto the floor, and Sam and I just stared and let him let them drip.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, to Sam, he said, “Man the front, kid,” and then, in my direction, “You, come with me.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I went.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the back office, good ol’ Brixby was lying on the floor with Matt’s pocket knife sticking out of his neck. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“...Damn,” I said. “So, he’s not, uh—”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Not a PI,” Matt finished for me. “Yeah, no.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“How did you—?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Had a feeling.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Then why did you—?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“‘Cause I wanted to corner him. And get him away from you two.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I nodded, because, okay. Enough said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The boxes containing the journals and divination tools were both open, and several of the items inside were lying askew, spread across the floor as though they’d been shuffled around during an altercation—which, I realized, they likely had. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the journals, however, was separate from the rest, having been placed with clear intent upon the countertop nearest Brixby’s head. It was open, only to the first page, baring the strange symbols that Alice and Jenny and I had marveled over when the books had first come into our possession. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Fucker started reading it and I—” Matt paused to cough and then opted for his sleeve over his bloodied hand to wipe his mouth. “I could tell shit was going down about halfway through the page. It got way too quiet, like the room was just sealed off all of a sudden and I couldn’t hear fuck all except his voice. And then my head just started…tingling. And that was enough to convince me to put a stop to that shit, which his crazy ass wasn’t too keen on, so. Did what I had to do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pretty much instantaneously, an awful fucking idea came to me. “What if we just…took him upstairs?” I said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Matt blinked at me. “I mean,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I shrugged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Grab his feet.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, listen, I know. I know it wasn’t the most morally sound move. But what you have to understand is the havoc this place would release on at the very least the immediate vicinity without Matt. He’s contracted in, and that keeps it at bay. If someone hauled his ass off to prison and he lost the building, either everything would be fucked beyond belief, or one of us would inherently become responsible. We look out for Matt so he can look out for us. Simple as that. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, we figured, no body, no crime. Wiley could scrub the tapes easily enough and we’d be in the clear. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I grabbed Not Brixby Leadingham, PI’s feet. Or, I guess, maybe Brixby Leadingham, Not PI. I’m not clear on whether that was actually his name. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mechanical room was dark, save for the dim emergency light in the center of the ceiling. We dropped the body with a dense thud as soon as we’d made it fully through the entrance, both panting with the effort of dragging likely 275 pounds of dead weight up an entire flight of stairs, and I couldn’t help but take note of the eerie glow cast over the pallid skin of the face, making it appear as though it had been lifeless far longer than it had in reality. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“How do you reckon we do this?” Matt asked, hands on his knees, smoker’s lungs still clearly not quite up to speed. “Never wanted to get their attention before.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I flicked my eyes upward, to the assumed nest above the doorway. It wasn’t dripping this time, but it was certainly still there, though poorly lit enough to prove difficult to make out. “Seems like the primary concern is pretty much always feeding for the…little ones,” I said, because fuck them kids, but using the word babies to describe the horrors that should have ended (and almost did end) Matt last time we’d had a run-in with them felt a little tone-deaf. “So maybe we just, I don’t know. Leave him here and they’ll get him when they’re ready? We could come back and check later. Make sure he’s gone.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Okay,” Matt agreed, righting himself. “Yeah.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So that was that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We headed back down the stairs in silence, and then I told Matt I was going to lock the doors until Della came in to clean, given the blood soaking cozily into several sections of flooring that we would undoubtedly only drive in deeper if we attempted to remedy the situation ourselves. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He nodded, offering me a two-fingered salute, and split off toward the desk, likely to let Sam know we’d survived. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I headed to the front, pulling the doors flush together, and raised my hand to turn the lock.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But before I could get quite that far, something slammed with a wet smack into the glass, directly parallel to my face. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’d think we’d be so used to jump scares around here that nothing could startle us anymore, but as a self proclaimed pussy, I jumped back a solid foot, barely catching myself in time to keep from planting ass first onto the ground. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That foot of space was all the girl outside needed to push her way in before I had a second to carry out my intent with the lock.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well. I guess girl is a loose term. It was most of one, though. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was really just that a slice seemed to have been carved out of her left side, from just below her eye socket into her upper thigh. No arm or anything there. Pieces of rib shaved off. Or, really, they just hadn’t finished generating. But I didn’t know that yet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I guess I screamed. I don’t remember doing it, but I don’t know why else Matt would’ve come running. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Oh,” he said, halting in his tracks just behind me. “Oh, fuck. Oh, god.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We were called,” the kind-of-girl said. There’d already been a steady trickle of blood streaming from the side of her mouth that wasn’t formed, but when she parted her lips, it began gushing, coating her teeth in a viscous, red-orange film. She didn’t appear to be in any way perturbed by this development, which for some reason was the element that chilled me to the bone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“...Huh?” I asked, because my brain was in my fucking guts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“By The Rite,” she elaborated unhelpfully. There was blood everywhere, I realized now. Her dark skin was glistening with it, and I absently felt guilty for failing to successfully lock her out and, by default, causing Della more work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Adam,” Matt said. That was all, but knowing each of his intonations as well as my own, I understood that this one was a command. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What—who—who are you?” I stammered, disregarding him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Culling,” she responded, blinking back at me with dull, inexpressive eyes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Adam.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Matt’s hand was on my shoulder now, and I shook it off. “No,” I told him. Then, to her, “The fuck does that mean?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In the aftermath of The Rite,” she said, “we, The Culling, are called to eliminate the disciples who have failed to rise to Enlightenment. Who among your herd is Enlightened?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Who among my—?” I started, but was cut off with a silencing wave of her hand. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Not you. It is not your herd. You.” She was looking past me now. Through me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You need to turn around,” Matt said, speaking directly to her for the first time, “and walk back out that door.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She simply stared ahead, unfazed, and repeated, “Who among your herd is Enlightened?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Out,” Matt insisted firmly. “Now.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, she took a step further inside, which inadvertently meant a step further toward me. I’m not sure what safety I thought it might afford me, but I caught my breath and held it in my throat, refusing to inhale what I knew would be the iron-dampened air around her. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was breathing plenty. Enough for both of us. Quickly, I surmised that this was because she was sniffing me. After a moment, her brow furrowed, and her eyes bore with something akin to accusation into mine. “There is no Enlightenment here,” she deduced. “None anywhere. It stinks of putrid, rotting Ignorance. Where was The Rite held?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Matt grabbed her by the half of her throat that existed, his thumb sunk with a wet squelch into the exposed mass of tendon and muscle on the other side, which made me feel like I was about a quarter of a second from meeting god, but she didn’t seem bothered in the least. Didn’t even lift a hand to try to stop him, like it wasn’t worth her time. And, probably, it wasn’t. When Matt tried to push her back, he may as well have been duking it out with a wall of steel. She didn’t budge. Not an inch. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his defense, he didn’t let an ounce of the fear undoubtedly coursing through his entire being show on his face. Instead, he insisted once again, “That’s enough. You’re not welcome here. I said it’s time to go.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ll give you a second, on a scale of one to ten, to guess how poorly you think that went.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you guessed anything under a fucking thousand, you’re SOL.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not only did she slam him straight to the ground, his head hitting the tile with a sickening crack, she also stepped directly onto his wrist to surpass him, causing his arm to elicit a crunching sound bones just weren’t designed to make.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I winced, but remained otherwise frozen, warring internally with whether to stay and help him or run as quickly as I could ahead of the girl to warn Sam. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, as per usual, Matt made the call for me. “Go,” he said, breathless, but clear and alert. “I’m good. Go.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I went. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To my absolute horror, when I turned back, I saw that she’d already gained an ungodly amount of ground. Somehow, already, she’d nearly reached the desk, where Sam was still standing, and long before I’d have been able to intervene if I’d tried, she’d caught his attention. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eyes wide, he stumbled back from the counter, taking in her left side—or, I guess, lack thereof—and her apparently nonexistent concern for her condition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sam!” I hollered from behind her, but it was too late. She’d made it to him already, slapping her sticky, blood-coated hand down onto the desk before him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You,” she seethed. “Where. Was. The. Rite. Held?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Something shifted, then, in his expression. I wasn’t sure what at the time, and it was so miniscule, so close to imperceptible, that I nearly missed it. But he stopped shying away from her eyes, swallowed down his discomfort, and said, “Upstairs.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, a tension I hadn’t noticed she’d been holding in her one existing shoulder seemed to relax. “Is the tome still there?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“...Yes,” was the response Sam opted for in place of asking her what the absolute bloody fuck was going on. “Would you like me to take you?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rather than verbal assent, the girl held her singular, bloody hand out to Sam.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’d made it to them now, and I shook my head at him once with a curt, stern finality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His gaze flitted briefly to mine, but didn’t linger. He stepped out from behind the counter and, steeling himself, took her hand. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What are you doing?” I demanded, grabbing the hem of his shirt as he made to turn away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s cool,” he told me, tapping my knuckle with his to indicate that I should let go. “I’ve got it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest, a part of me wanted to just let him. Not because I’d ever want anything bad to happen to him, of course—it’s just that, sometimes, this shit starts to weigh on you. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I didn’t do that. I learned fairly quickly with Sam that if he had his mind made up he was going to follow through with whatever it was he’d decided he was going to do and there really wasn’t any point in trying to dissuade him. So I followed him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He didn’t try to stop me, likely for within the same ballpark of reasoning. And the girl didn’t seem to give a shit that I was there as long as she thought she was getting what she wanted. So. Win win, I guess?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, I didn’t know precisely what Sam’s plan was, but I’d have ventured to bet it flew entirely out the fucking window as soon as the girl saw the body of Possibly Brixby Leadingham, Definitely Not PI lying dead on the floor. The robodactyls still hadn’t gotten to him yet, it would seem, and the way the girl started wailing, you’d think she’d been sawed in half. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well. In half…the other way? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was easily the most visceral, guttural scream-crying I’ve ever heard in my twenty-some years on his earth, and the sheer volume and intensity of it drew my attention momentarily from the fact that she was saying something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Father!” is what it was. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some shit started clicking then. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s some wordplay for you. Because shit started clicking, like, in my brain, but also literally, audibly, some shit started clicking. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a sound I remembered well enough that I didn’t have a ton of time to zero in on the revelations I was having, on account of the imminent descent of the winged monstrosities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I guess I looked like I was about to piss myself (I was), because Sam took that opportunity to project his voice over the unceasing shrieks and tell me, “It’s okay. They’re not—they won’t hurt us. Just let them come.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I didn’t know what the fuck that meant, but I figured worst case scenario I’d be dead quick and then it wasn’t really my problem anymore, so I stood, unmoving, and watched them clamber clumsily down from their nest. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The screaming was rapidly shifting form, spreading into a cacophony of something more sinister and abstract, and technically nothing was happening to the almost-body before me, but I began to perceive it differently, as the mechanical-bat-birds started to swoop down upon it. It felt less like a malformed body and more like the idea of one, and I shuddered when I remembered something it had said downstairs, about ‘we’. It did, in fact, sound more akin to multiple voices than a singular now. And it wasn’t quite moving in the tandem way that a body belonging to a singular consciousness should. It was becoming more disjointed, twitching and flailing, and, I realized, frantically scrambling to protect the body of our dearly departed Brixby.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What the hell?” Sam said, which drew my attention back to him and returned my fascination to the fact that, true to his word, the flying horrors were indeed not attacking us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yeah, what the hell?” I echoed. “How come they’re not eating us?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sam looked over to me, a little guiltily, and shrugged. “I…I don’t know. They just don’t hurt me. And I knew if you were with me, they wouldn’t hurt you either. I don’t have a good answer right now. I’m trying to figure it out.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I didn’t press him on it, because, fine. Fair enough. Sometimes shit’s just weird here—I think we’re all aware enough of that. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We went back to watching the creatures rip apart the corpses (plural, they were both certainly dead now) before us, viscera flying haphazardly between them, the frenzy making it difficult to tell how much of either of them was left after some time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They’re getting bigger already,” I noted, in reference to the dinosaur-bat-birds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” Sam agreed, scratching anxiously at his right arm with his left. “They’re doing okay without their mom, I think. Doesn’t seem like they really need to eat often at all. This is more like…a treat, I guess?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Huh.” I wanted to grill him about how and also why the fuck he knew that, but this didn’t feel like the time. Partly because we were watching two people (or, people adjacent beings, at least) be eviscerated, but also because the wailing was back, except that practically everything about it had changed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was hard to say, really, how I could tell they were the same voices as before, but I knew it. Sam did, too—I could tell from the way he stilled next to me. They were disembodied now, though. There was nothing for them to tie themselves to, now that their host was gone. But that didn’t keep them from speaking their piece. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our final form was never reached,” the voices whispered, from nowhere and everywhere around us at once. As though someone had flipped a killswitch, the avian nightmares stopped cold, frozen in midair. “We have generated incomplete vessels in the past, so, at first, we bade it no mind. But this time, there was a cause. The Rite was not completed. Something cut it short. Something Culled Father.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, this set off a couple of warning bells for me, because how had Matt’s pocket knife taken out something we were currently being led to believe was more powerful than what had appeared to be a relatively small, three-quarters-formed, roughly late-teenaged girl who’d laid him out flat with nothing more than the flick of her fingers?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, I didn’t feel particularly invited to toss my two cents in the well, so I made the informed decision to not. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I’d anticipated, the conglomerate of unison speech continued, gurgling and tangling over itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This will be a heavy weight to bear. A handsome debt to pay. The Culling will not rest until a vessel is rebuilt. Until we avenge Father, by ascending his conqueror in his stead.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every drop of blood in my body felt as though it was slowly, agonizingly turning to ice. I didn’t have the details, but I didn’t need to. I understood what I was hearing. Whatever bullshit circus this was, B. Leadingham, Untitled had been its fucking ringleader. And now Matt was set to take his place. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“No,” I heard more than felt myself say. “No. You don’t fucking touch him. There has to be something else you want. What is it? What’s an acceptable trade?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was a long, swelling pause. I thought, briefly, that my counter wasn’t going to be entertained. Then, airily, as though the sound was seeping from the walls, “The herd may come to the agreement, as one, to sacrifice something that can neither be traded nor bought.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I heard Sam swallow next to me and wondered if he was as nauseous as I was. “What do you mean?” he asked. “What does that mean, ‘something that can’t be traded or bought’?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We understand it in far more depth than your kind could ever dream of, but what we ask of you is, in your terms, time.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sam and I exchanged a Glance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As long as you come to a consensus,” the voices went on, “it shan’t be much. Not enough to impact your dismal life expectancies. Do this, and your Shepherd shall be free.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Fine,” I said instantaneously. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know. Not making deals with shit isn’t even in the rules, which is undoubtedly because Matt didn’t think he’d ever hire anyone stupid enough to need something so obvious spelled out for them. I’m truly one in a million. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my defense, though, Sam shadowed me. “Fine,” he said, too. “Whatever. Just leave him alone.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We shall remain here,” the chorus promised, “for the rise and set of seven suns. On the eve of the eighth rising, unless your deliberation has sooner ceased, we will collect our due. If each member of the herd does not consent to sacrifice their measure of time willingly, your Shepherd’s Ascension shall commence.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sound wasn’t any different, really, than any of the breaks in speech had been thus far. It was the feeling that told us the conversation was over. Like the air in the room was moving differently somehow, even before the monstrosities had un-paused. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They lagged a moment, but sluggishly started to move again, though by no means at their typical pace. They dragged themselves along the floor, their metalwork bodies suddenly too heavy for their wings to support, leaving trails of sludgy blood in their wake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sam, bless his heart, looked concerned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Do you think they’re hurt?” he wondered aloud, kneeling to inspect the nearest one more closely. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to unpack the logistics of his relationship to these things in the midst of the current situation, or, really, at all, given that I didn’t know if he had any idea that they were somehow at fault for his lack of an existence outside of the library. It wasn’t like we’d had a fireside chat about it, and it wasn’t a conversation I was going to start if he never felt like it was necessary, so I just let him go about his mother hen fretting for a minute until, finally, the things kicked their half-speed setting and darted back up to the ceiling to hunker down again, iron bull bellies full of (presumably human) flesh. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Maybe they were just…booting back up,” I said, clapping a hand on his shoulder. “Come on, let’s get the fuck out of here. Matt’s hurt, I think. Not bad—” (That, around here, means an injury’s not life-threatening.) “—but he might have a concussion, and his wrist has gotta be broken.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Oh, damn,” Sam said, surveying the damage on the ground and then waving a hand at it dismissively. “They’ll…they’ll lick the rest up later. Let’s go.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Matt was looking for us, unsurprisingly, when we made it back out to the main floor. “Where is she?” he asked, trying and failing to fully suppress how frantically he was studying both Sam and myself for injuries. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sam opened his mouth, but I cut him off before he could get a word out. “Gone,” I relayed simply. He couldn’t, of course, know what we’d agreed to. I was sure Sam and I were on the same page about it, but just in case, I wasn’t going to take any chances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Matt nodded and then clenched his jaw, likely against the pain in his skull. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Okay?” I asked. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Della’s here,” he deflected. “Think we’re still gonna shut it down for the night, though. Just give her some time to get everything straightened up. You can head home, Adam, if you want.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Alright,” I said. I didn’t, though. I think he knew I wouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, Sam and I pretended not to notice the snoring approximately five minutes after he disappeared into the back to “do some paperwork” and then we got to work helping Della clean up the floors (only with whatever products she shoved into our hands, naturally).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until the next night that we called the meeting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, it was unanimous. Della even tipped her head in confirmation. I’d like to call back to the beginning of this post, when we discussed the universal understanding of the utmost importance in this building centering unwaveringly on protecting Matt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The discussion didn’t go down without questions—Alice wanted to know how much time we were offering up (we had no clue) and Horace wondered how we knew whatever this entity was would play fairly (we didn’t) and Jenny requested that we repeat every detail of the encounter to the letter in case there was something she could pick out that we’d managed to miss (there wasn’t). Wiley, perhaps the most unwaveringly loyal to Matt of us all, only asked what we needed to do to seal the deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We decided we’d take the time we were allotted, just to do whatever we felt we could to prepare ourselves. It was still too fresh on my mind the day after, too suffocating, which gave me the perfect opportunity to shift my focus to the story about Doug. But I planned to write all this out before we made it to the end of the week, and to post it as quickly as I could to try and garner some advice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That was, apparently, a year ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The funny thing is, in all our consideration, we never thought that whatever time we might forfeit may not be taken off the ends of our lives, but, rather, carved right out of the present.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t know what the date was. Everything is too blurry around the edges. This platform only shows me that I last posted “1 year ago.” So maybe it was a little longer. Maybe a little less. I’m not sure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s been nearly a week, now, that we’ve been back. If it’s all the same, I’d rather not get into the specifics of waking up to the realization that I was missing the last year of my life. We’re operating the way we always do—the way we always have. We’re moving along. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We experienced it together, at least. Jenny started the group call within sixty seconds of the lot of us returning to awareness, and I was surprised by the gravity of the relief that shocked my system when I learned that, if I was finally losing the last shreds of sanity I had left, at least I wasn’t doing it alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biggest difference I’ve placed so far is that every book in every box in the room where the donations were held (along with the boxes themselves, and everything else that came in them as well) has vanished. I want to know what happened to them—where they are now, if they’re anywhere at all; if they were destroyed or buried or if they glitched out of existence when our deal was fulfilled—but I can’t ask.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Matt’s right wrist clicks when he types now, like a long-healed fracture that was never set quite back in place. But as far as we can tell, that’s the closest to any memory he has of the events of that night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As far as we can tell, he’s none the wiser about the bargain we made. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As far as we can tell, he has no idea we were ever gone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/emorybored&quot;&gt; /u/emorybored &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1r0ng/i_work_at_the_night_library_i_thought_id_last/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1r0ng/i_work_at_the_night_library_i_thought_id_last/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c1r0ng</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1r0ng/i_work_at_the_night_library_i_thought_id_last/" /><updated>2024-04-11T21:33:33+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-11T21:33:33+00:00</published><title>I work at the Night Library.

A small family-owned laundromat that sits right next to a Circle K. My savings are running low so... I got a job. You know, I thought it would distract me but it really hasn&amp;#39;t. I just get home more exhausted than normal. Why did she have to go? What gave her the bright idea to go!? Better question. Why didn&amp;#39;t she tell me? These are the only thoughts on my mind recently. I&amp;#39;ve yet to tell my family because Honestly, I&amp;#39;m to scared. What if they go to. What&amp;#39;ll happen to them? Each time I think of her, I think of that... that well. Those drawings clearly depict cannibalism. I can&amp;#39;t bring myself to do anything. And honestly, I&amp;#39;m fucking pissed more than anything. I&amp;#39;m pissed that I haven&amp;#39;t done anything. And I&amp;#39;m pissed that she&amp;#39;s... I have been at the ranch for a day now. My parents asked me to look after it while they were on vacation. Don&amp;#39;t have to pay rent haha... Im going to bed right now ill update this later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You know people are always saying they&amp;#39;re afraid of the dark. I can understand that right? Darkness has set it. Nothing but darkness around you. The light from your house can only illuminate so far out into to open night. It can be pretty scary. I always thought the night was objectively the scariest time of the day. But I was wrong. There is no safety in daylight. There is no bliss till nightfall. I saw him watching me. I woke up this morning doing my regular routine. Eating breakfast, brushing teeth, etc. I decided to do some research. I started looking into disappearances near Phoenix. Not surprisingly in a place like Phoenix, there are a lot of missing people. I was looking for anything on my sister. Any report that was given. I did find one but it didn&amp;#39;t give me anything new. I didn&amp;#39;t get much further before my alarm went off scaring the shit out of me. I had woken up about an hour early and I must have forgotten to turn it off. At that moment I realized that the alarm was for waking me up for work. So I left my laptop and went to my car.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I got in my car started the engine and began to drive off. The road out is pretty long. Long enough to have two gates that you have to close manually on the way out. My parents installed them to keep anyone who decided to go further into the desert from driving up onto the property. Makes sense but I find it tedious to do every time I leave. But that&amp;#39;s just me. After about a minute I get to the first gate and I get out and close it. Hop back in and start heading to the next one. But as I&amp;#39;m driving I take a quick look in the rearview mirror. And I see up on the cliff side a figure standing at the top looking in my direction. I tap the brakes and slow down to a crawl as I stare at this clearly human figure staring presumably at me. I keep at a crawl for about another twenty seconds or so before finally stopping. I sit and wait. As I do I notice my palms are pretty sweaty. And I feel just a tad uneasy. I wait hoping this figure just walks away or something but it just stands there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My patients starts to give as I sit. At that moment I remember trying to decide whether I was going to keep going or turn back. My mind filled with what could or what would happen if I stayed or went. And my thoughts were instantly interrupted by what I saw just below him. Another figure staring from a distance. He definitely wasn&amp;#39;t there the first time I looked. What I did next was. To put it bluntly, stupid. All I could think about was so many questions at that moment. Who are they? What do they want? Do they have Sarah!? Well... I wanted answers. I put the car in reverse and peeled out of the rough gravel below flying backward scared and confused but determined to get something. But I hadn&amp;#39;t even moved thirty feet before I hit the brakes this time hard. Halting the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They were gone. thinking back now. I don&amp;#39;t even know if they were there in the first place. But never the less. They were gone. Was I going crazy? Am I Going crazy? They were there for a moment and by the time I had hit reversed and started moving they had disappeared. I vividly remember sitting there with the engine running for about thirty minutes. Thinking back. Don&amp;#39;t know what I was thinking about. I just remember being utterly confused and angry. Furious really. Like whoever these people were they were fucking with me. for the fun of it. My anger slowly simmered to a horrifying feeling. Someone is watching me. And Something tells me they come from well. I drove off and finished my day of work. I met the lady that ran the place and her daughter. Me and her got along pretty well actually and for a second I was in bliss. I hadn&amp;#39;t thought about well anything throughout the whole day. That is till I reached the on the way back to the ranch. Where my thoughts about work were abruptly interrupted when I hit the rough and bumpy dirt road. And my uneasy feeling from this morning came to crawl back up when &amp;quot;that&amp;quot; mountain came into view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I cautiously made my way back to the house. From there I skipped dinner and I of course made sure every door was locked. Then I went straight to my bed. Exhausted like normal I would have slept just fine. But the recent memory of those figures were the only things keeping me up for most of that night. I eventually close my eyes and wake at noon to the sound of my phone ringing. I look and it is an unknown number. Normally I would ignore this but at the time I had yet to get my boss&amp;#39;s number so I didn&amp;#39;t want to take my chances of missing her call. I answer and all I hear is static. I wait about twenty seconds before I go to hang up but I&amp;#39;m stopped by the disturbing sound of breathing. Heavy labored breathing mixed in with the static. A shiver goes down my spine. I&amp;#39;m frozen. I do however manage to muster up the words&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maxus- He- Hello?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was never an answer. But I do know who was on the other side. I look up at the clock and in my peripheral I see standing in a bush, fifteen feet or so away from my window, A man staring in at me holding the phone. My stomach drops. And I&amp;#39;m stuck there staring. My grip on my phone loosened. And my phone slips out of my hand as I am stuck in a petrified state of fear. It&amp;#39;s immediately clear why he is breathing so heavily. He&amp;#39;s wearing the head of a donkey. The head is much smaller I recall than an adult. So it must have been a younger and smaller one. The man was not completely naked. barely any muscle at all. In fact, he looked very frail almost malnourished even. The staring went on for about another ten seconds before I heard something from the phone. He had spoken. However, I didn&amp;#39;t hear it because my phone had fallen out of my hands and it was not on speaker. But he had said something. The only word I could make out was... Feast. The stare didn&amp;#39;t last much longer after that. He hung up the phone and casually walked down the road before running off toward the direction of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I called the police not long after that. They snooped around and didn&amp;#39;t find anything. No tracks no nothing. No sign of anyone near me. They told me to keep an eye out and call if I needed anything before they headed off. And that brings us to now. I&amp;#39;ve been in bed for at least more than a day now. Haven&amp;#39;t moved much. I did research some more. Turns out there was a woman who went missing about three years ago. Right near... Lake Pleasant. I was right when I said the mountain was watching. it still is. I have been desperately trying to turn off my brain. Trying to not think of what they di- have done to Sarah. I&amp;#39;m scared. I&amp;#39;m Really fucking scared. The desert is so quiet tonight. Nothing but the small solar-powered lights that are spread throughout the long driveway. Each one with just enough light to illuminate the base of the many agave plants and the tall Emory Oaks. I think I have to do something. Something bad is coming. And I don&amp;#39;t wanna sit around and wait as these freaks watch me through my windows. I&amp;#39;m going tomorrow night. I&amp;#39;m going to that well. And I&amp;#39;m going to find Sarah. And we&amp;#39;re gonna move far away from that fucking mountain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The desert&amp;#39;s quiet...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m on my way Sarah.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/MrKringle111&quot;&gt; /u/MrKringle111 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c21sfh/lake_pleasant_well_part_2/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c21sfh/lake_pleasant_well_part_2/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c21sfh</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c21sfh/lake_pleasant_well_part_2/" /><updated>2024-04-12T06:04:32+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-12T06:04:32+00:00</published><title>Lake Pleasant Well: Part 2</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/CIAHerpes</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/CIAHerpes</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had always liked collecting rare books and paintings with the extra money I made trading stock options on the side. My small, two-bedroom house was cluttered with them. I had bookshelves filled with original signed copies of works by Stephen King, Philip K. Dick and Hunter S. Thompson that I had saved for years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also tried to find ascending painters in the local art scene and buy up some of their works for very low prices before they got discovered. Sometimes it worked out, and sometimes it didn’t, but as a whole, I had made far more money than I had lost over the decades. All of the works I liked most, though, I refused to sell at any price.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And these included the paintings of HG Bittaker. After his mysterious death a few years ago, they had gotten the same kind of reputation as paintings done by serial killers like John Wayne Gacy that were sold openly, sometimes for tens of thousands of dollars, on the internet. And like Gacy’s strange portraits of Snow White or the Seven Dwarves or grinning clowns, Bittaker’s paintings all had a sinister and otherworldly pull.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had kept them locked up in a storage unit, but when the storage company told me they would be doubling their rates, I decided to close the unit and take everything in it back to my house. I set up the macabre paintings around my room and the hallways, remembering the strange conversation I had with the artist just days before his untimely death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People like to say that ‘life is art’ and meaningless platitudes like that,” HG Bittaker had said as he stood in front of a painting of a victim of murder made to look like Shiva dancing the Tandava. The black, eyeless sockets of the victim stared straight out at the viewer. His mouth was open, showing a spiraling galaxy of shining stars hidden within. Four emaciated, pale arms jutted out from the sides of the starving body, bent in the same posture as Shiva’s eternal cosmic dance. The arms showed signs of torture, patches of burnt and melted flesh eaten into the body like a cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One mutilated leg was lifted into the air in a half-kicking motion. Deep gashes were sliced into its skin and muscle, revealing the white bone gleaming underneath. The emaciated dancer stood on a mountain of hundreds of skulls, many of them with fragments of hair and pieces of gore still clinging to the bone. Feeling slightly sickened, I turned away, chugging the entire bottle of beer I held in a few long swallows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But you know what I think? I think death is the true art,” HG Bittaker continued, his gray eyes flashing over me. They looked flat and lifeless, as if all the hope had long ago been sucked out of this young artist. His face was narrow and serious with high cheekbones and close-cropped black hair. “It is the gateway to eternity, after all. The best art comes not from love of life, but from love of death and annihilation.” I nodded as if I understood, though in reality, I didn’t know what he was getting at. I figured he was just another eccentric artist rambling about philosophies he barely understood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So what inspired you to paint this piece, for example?” I said, glancing at the macabre murder victim piece. It had a small white placard next to it that read,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;The Damned Spirits Dance the Tandava.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HG Bittaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oil, marker, hair, blood.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I recognized immediately that the placard showed the name of the piece, the artist, the year it was created and the materials used to create the piece. But it had to be a joke. I squinted at the last line, reading it over again. All around us, people chattered softly as they sipped wine and sodas, moving slowly around the hall. The entire exhibit showed dozens of HG Bittaker paintings, all of them extremely disturbing. I saw a painting of mass graves under a cold, black sky with rings like those of Saturn extending far out into the void. Next to it stood one of a monk burning himself alive while sitting in complete peace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This piece was inspired from a dream I had- or maybe, I should call it a nightmare. Do you know what the Tandava is?” HG Bittaker asked me, his gray eyes flashing with excitement for the first time that night. I shook my head, but I leaned close, interested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Hindus believe that we exist in an eternal multiverse where countless universes are constantly being created and destroyed. The multiverse exists as the body of Vishnu the Maintainer, which stretches out forever outside of time. His maintenance is really just the ultimate reality from which all universes constantly spring. They say that the individual creator god for each universe arises out of Vishnu’s navel. The creator is only a finite god with limited power, a being who they call Brahma. Brahma eventually ages and dies, just like the universe itself. For, you see, Brahma the Creator is by far the weakest of the three. The eternal presence of the multiverse and the omnipresent power of death and destruction are much more powerful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When a universe has grown ancient, when it has started to turn gray and fade towards death, one far more powerful than the creator appears: Shiva the Destroyer. At that point, he begins his final dance for that universe- the Tandava, it is called.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“After Shiva starts to dance the Tandava, it cannot be stopped until everything in the universe is destroyed. He dances faster and faster until all the remaining matter and energy is annihilated, released back into consciousness. He does this not out of hatred or spite, you understand, but out of love for all beings. In the destruction of the universe, enlightenment shines through, and the pure consciousness released can be used to start the process of creation again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So you asked about what inspired this particular piece. Well, in one recurring nightmare I had, I saw this man, this pale victim of some death camp, I guess. His eyes had been cut out. His still body lay on top of a mass grave of rotting bodies with maggots writhing in his skin and hair. He showed clear signs of torture before the merciful release of death took him away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The many arms of the hundreds of other victims lying beneath him started to slither up like snakes, as if the dead were slowly coming back to life. It was like they were trying to reach upwards, trying to reach towards freedom from the rotting pit of horrors they found themselves in. The man on top, the one you see in this painting here, lifted his head and looked straight at me. His blue lips twitched and he abruptly inhaled again, but it sounded like his throat was filled with blood and dirt. Finally, he opened his mouth and, with a gurgling wail that seemed to come straight from Hell itself, he spoke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“‘Everything is growing old and sick here,’ he hissed at me. ‘The dance will begin again soon.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“And then the sky went black and a burning cold descended on the world. A freezing wind blew. I looked up into the sky and felt something dreadful and powerful hidden within those swirling currents of darkness. Through the black mist, I could see the barest silhouette of something massive, something whose entire body stretched across the sky- and I saw it was dancing.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the art show, I had gone home and thought deeply about the words the tortured artist had said. His gray, lifeless eyes kept flashing through my mind. That night, I drank myself into a black-out, until the merciful release of sleep took away the cycle of thoughts that seemed to repeat in my mind like a skipping record.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was three days later, after I had gotten home from work late, that I saw the news. I remember walking into my house and turning on the flat-screen TV as I poured myself a full glass of whiskey. Within minutes, I had chugged the entire thing. I knew that I drank too much, that I couldn’t stop, and that, eventually, my addiction would probably kill me. I figured that, in the end, I would follow millions of other alcoholics off that dark cliff of fatal addiction into eternity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“BREAKING NEWS” suddenly flashed across the screen as a TV reporter stood in front of an expensive apartment building under a dark, cloudless sky. It was a ritzy, expensive part of town near the art gallery. Police cars filled the street behind her as she smoothed a long lock of hair behind her ear. She blinked fast at the camera, seeming to finally realize she was live.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m here with Channel Five News in front of the Angel Trace Apartment building where police are investigating multiple bodies found inside one of the residences. We have heard reports from police that the body of the locally renowned artist HG Bittaker was also recovered at the crime scene. Police refuse to say what connection, if any, Mr. Bittaker may have had with…” I rose from my chair, frantically shutting off the TV. The strange conversation I had with the artist a few days ago flashed through my mind over and over. But now, the conversation seemed more sinister.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later that night, I went over to the computer and started doing some research. On various internet forums, I found strange things floating around. Those investigating the case said the victims were found chained inside HG Bittaker’s apartment and that the police believed he had died from suicide. A lot of this was still speculation and rumor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While much of it was unconfirmed at first, within a couple days, it would all be proven beyond a shadow of a doubt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I would find out over time, the bodies of eight women were laid around HG Bittaker in a shape like a lotus petal. They showed signs of extensive, prolonged torture before their inevitable deaths from strangulation. Like the painting I had seen in the gallery, these victims had their eyes cut out from their sockets. They had their arms and legs burned or doused in some corrosive acid, and strange occult symbols had been carved into the chests and stomachs of their naked, mutilated bodies. They had suffered greatly before the merciful release of oblivion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the center of the circle of death, the police had found the body of HG Bittaker himself. He had burned himself alive while sitting in the full-lotus position. The neighbors had noticed the choking clouds of black smoke that reeked of searing meat and gasoline. They kicked the door down only to find a den of horrors waiting beyond.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HG Bittaker had still been alive at that point, they said, and he had shown no signs of pain at all as he sat there, burning. Fat sizzled off his body in drops as his skin blackened and cooked. The neighbors extinguished the fire before it could spread, but by then, HG Bittaker was dead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apparently, HG Bittaker had his own personal library with countless leather-bound tomes on the occult and practices of human sacrifice. Books about the Thuggees and ancient devotional practices to both Kali and Shiva were also found scattered all over the apartment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After hearing this, I did some research about the Thuggees, a group of cultists in India who were estimated to have murdered up to two million people and where the word “thug” came from. They were cultists who would waylay travelers on the road, strangling them or breaking their necks with special nooses or silk handkerchiefs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Thuggees were devoted followers of the goddess of death and destruction, Kali. They believed they were saving the world by murdering innocent travelers in cold blood, for they offered these victims to the goddess Kali. They hoped their sacrifices would keep Kali satiated, so that she would not descend and destroy the entire world in a dancing inferno of death and destruction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I sat in front of the computer with a glass of scotch in my hand, my head started to feel like it was spinning from all the strangeness of the case. It seemed like I had many breadcrumbs here that must connect in some way, but for the life of me, I could not figure out how. Before the night was over, however, I would understand everything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I glanced behind me at the painting I had bought from HG Bittaker after the artshow, the one showing the emaciated death camp victim dancing the cosmic Tandava. The eyeless sockets of that pale face seemed to stare directly into my soul. I shuddered, turning away and back to my empty glass.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I ended up refilling my glass to the brim with some expensive scotch while I did my research. I leaned back in the computer chair with a long sigh before sipping the burning liquid that loosened the knots of anxiety and dread in my heart. As I sat alone in that dark room, only the glare of the monitor sent the skittering shadows away. Behind me, the painting continuously stared at me from the wall, grinning like a skull.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I must have passed out at some point. The anesthetizing fog of the alcohol descended slowly over my mind. I don’t remember falling asleep, but I certainly remember waking up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The room was totally dark now, the monitor having shut off. I blinked slowly, my head feeling hazy. The room seemed to spin around me. I couldn’t see the spinning, but I could feel it thrumming through my whole body. My stomach was churning. My throat felt dry, as if I had been sipping hydrochloric acid. But why had I woken up suddenly? I didn’t know. I felt confused, and everything seemed slow. I was still drunk, I knew, though some of the fog seemed to have cleared as I slept.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I heard a floorboard groan behind me. There was a sudden ragged inhalation of breath, a slow, pained gurgling, as if someone were choking on their own blood. The diseased inhalation and exhalation rang out through the silence. I heard a skittering of light footsteps and the slamming of a door.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I fumbled in my pocket for my cigarette lighter, pulling it out and flicking it. I stumbled out of the chair, holding the small, flickering light in front of me like a shield. It barely drove the shadows back. They seemed to press in all around me like the spikes of an iron maiden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I got to the light and tried flicking it, but the power had gone off for some reason. Sweating and nervous, I stopped and listened. I heard the stairs creak. Off in the distance, that gurgling breathing continued. I swore under my breath. It must be a robber, I thought. Someone probably broke in while I passed out and cut the circuit breaker. I looked around the room for a weapon, when I noticed something truly bizarre.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My lighter flicked over the painting I kept hanging on the wall, the one called, “&lt;em&gt;The Damned Spirits Dance the Tandava&lt;/em&gt;”. It looked different, and I immediately realized why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The skulls piled on the black earth at the bottom of the painting still gleamed in the dim glare of the lighter’s flame, but the dancing, eyeless man in the painting had disappeared. The stars glimmered in the endless void in the background with their cold white light.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It had to be a joke, I thought to myself. But why would someone go to this length? I lived alone and had few friends. Certainly no one would break in and swap a painting as some kind of prank. I spotted a metal letter opener over on the desk. It wasn’t much, but it was all I had up here. I grabbed it and left the room, heading downstairs. I no longer heard any movement or breathing down there, but I felt some sort of presence, as if the shadows themselves had eyes that were watching me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I felt as if I were in some sort of nightmare as I descended the stairs. The wood groaned softly under my weight. My heart pounded as I moved forward. As I reached the bottom step, that diseased gurgling rang out nearby. I spun, seeing the naked, emaciated body with the four arms standing at the window in the dark kitchen, staring blindly out into the world with his black sockets of eyes. The strange man turned to face me. His face split into a grin, revealing the brown, rotted teeth hidden beneath and the maggots squirming in his putrefying tongue and gums.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What do you want?” I whispered, terrified. “Who are you?” The grin seemed to widen further, the decaying flesh splitting along the seams of his lips. Dark, clotted blood dripped down from the torn flaps of skin on his cheeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Do you not recognize me, John?” the thing spoke in a voice that writhed with sickness and death. But, at the same time, I recognized it. It was the voice of HG Bittaker, the dead artist and serial killer. “I mixed my own blood and the blood of those holy ones who gave their lives to me with the paintings. Even strands of their hair are in there, dried between the layers of paint. Strands of their hair- and mine. Our essences have mixed, the killer and killed, the strong and weak, the perpetrator and the victim, and the deathless self shines through all of it. Now I have gone beyond death.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pale man stepped towards me, his mutilated legs cracking as the stiff limbs twisted and jerked, as if fighting the effects of rigor mortis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m dreaming,” I said, backpedaling away as he advanced on me. “This can’t be real. You’re dead! You burned yourself alive! It was all over the news, goddamn it!” With inhuman speed, the mutilated man oozed towards me, grabbing me by the head with his cold, dead hands. The skin felt loose, almost falling off the bone, and the smell of rot and putrefaction emanated from the body in thick clouds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I have made a friend of death,” he hissed through his blackened teeth as maggots dripped from his blue lips. “You, too, will find peace in death.” He lunged forward suddenly. I felt his sharp splinters of broken teeth sink into my neck. A scream ripped its way out of my throat as I thrashed and kicked. Through the haze of pain, I abruptly remembered the letter opener in my hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I brought it up into the body of the naked, rotting corpse, slicing deeply across his stomach. The thin skin burst open with a waterfall of clotted blood running out like sludge. The brown intestines of the corpse inside spilled out, writhing with hundreds of larvae like pale worms that feasted on the dead flesh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pale man gave a hissing scream. Black blood burst from his mouth, covering my face in its sickly spatters. My hands grew slick as my blood mixed with the fetid fluids dripping from the animated corpse. He pulled away with a banshee wail. I collapsed to the floor, holding my spurting neck with both hands as I slowly crawled away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I heard a window shatter behind me. Looking back, I saw the kitchen empty. The pale man had apparently jumped through the front window, leaving pieces of his decaying flesh hanging from the jagged shards of glass.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the last of my strength, I slowly made my way toward the front door. Feeling weak and sick, stumbling as blood poured from my neck, I made my way to the neighbor’s house. I pounded on their door, collapsing on the mat as they opened it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I got home from the hospital, I went upstairs to look at the painting. A deep sense of curiosity mixed with an overwhelming dread as I opened the door.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I saw the pile of skulls, the stars like fragments of opal, but the pale victim at the center of the painting was gone forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/CIAHerpes&quot;&gt; /u/CIAHerpes &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1awqu/i_once_knew_a_painter_who_used_to_mix_blood_in/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1awqu/i_once_knew_a_painter_who_used_to_mix_blood_in/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c1awqu</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1awqu/i_once_knew_a_painter_who_used_to_mix_blood_in/" /><updated>2024-04-11T09:36:54+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-11T09:36:54+00:00</published><title>I once knew a painter who used to mix blood in with the paint.

War remains constant and unchanging, regardless of circumstances, motives, or the extent of its devastation and casualties. The desire for the demise of others persists among individuals, and the only solution is the complete annihilation of all living beings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This project began with the intention of creating a powerful weapon to defeat the fast-approaching enemy. It was designed to be the most advanced machine of war, and losing was not an acceptable outcome. Desperation was setting in as we sought a quick resolution to the impending conflict. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was considered the most talented inventor in our government up to this point, and it was inevitable that they would eventually try to control me, this error would have negative consequences for the entire world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our government generously provided us with ample funding to finish this project, but as I stepped into the laboratory that would be my home for the next few years, it was clear that some shortcuts had been taken.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This project was located in a subterranean building, accessible only through a discreet set of elevators located far from civilization. In case of elevator failure, there is an emergency ladder within the building&amp;#39;s depths. In case of an dire emergency, we could either leave the building or seek refuge in the emergency shelter until the threat was erased.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, I am seeking refuge in this emergency shelter, unsure of whether I will be saved or meet my demise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While I wait, I will share with you the tale of how I birthed forth a horrifying monster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government&amp;#39;s objective was to develop an innovative weapon unlike any other seen before, a special machine powered not by traditional sources of energy but by something essential to organic beings - blood. Blood served as the source of power for the machine, which was programmed to eliminate all adversaries and retrieve blood to continue it&amp;#39;s mission. However, in exchange for its advanced fuel system, we had to strip away protective armor from its chassis, leaving it lightweight and vulnerable to destruction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the heat of battle, the Machine known as &amp;quot;Version 1&amp;quot; was armed with a self-learning program that utilized Machine Learning to adapt and use any weapon available on the battlefield, while also avoiding different types of various projectiles. Finally, we set it up to locate and eliminate any potential threats that could cause harm, its single yellow eye is able to spot its adversaries regardless of their camouflage or strategic positioning, a truly adaptable machine that would not give up in a fight. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If my machine were to harm an ally, I risk losing funding, facing embarrassment, and the destruction of my creation. Thankfully, my coding expertise should prevent such a catastrophic event.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is not surprising that the government hastily deployed the machine to the field without conducting thorough bug-testing, all in an effort to quickly end the ongoing war. &amp;quot;Version 1&amp;quot; performed exceptionally well, effortlessly overcoming any obstacles posed by the enemy in terms of position, appearance, or number of troops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The robot decisively annihilated the oncoming army, showing no mercy as it absorbed the blood of it&amp;#39;s enemies. This allowed us to closely study the robot&amp;#39;s fuel system and make necessary adjustments to improve its performance. The machine now had the ability to regenerate from injuries by using blood to initiate a self-repair process, ensuring it could operate for a longer period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All that was left to do was correct any mistakes and make minor tweaks to prepare the machine for use. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Then all Hell broke loose.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the process of fixing the machine and reviewing its machine-learning code for the issues I previously pointed out, the nightmare awoke. Several wires were connected to the Machine, suspending it in the air like a marionette, turned off and secure; a scientist was positioned at the back of its head to reach a port when abruptly the Machine powered on and broke free from the wires, mistakenly identifying a staff member as a threat and delivering a powerful punch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His head burst, splattering blood and brain tissue all over the walls and the people nearby. I was fortunate to be at a safe distance down the hallway when the commotion began - alarms blaring, guards rushing to the examination room. Amidst the chaos, there were cries and gunfire, with a few scientists fleeing for their lives. I stumbled and fell, frantically calling out to the guards for an explanation. All I could make out from their hurried remarks was something about an &amp;quot;emergency malfunction&amp;quot; and the urgency to seek shelter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I immediately sprang into action without hesitation and began sprinting towards the exit, but my curiosity got the best of me when I foolishly looked behind me. The scientists and guards were no match for the Machine as it unleashed deadly accuracy with a gun it had seized after eliminating a few guards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Created with cruel perfection in mind, the Machine left no hope for the humans trapped in the building. The only option was to flee and abandon the building before the Machine found a way to escape. I decided to make my escape using the elevator, The Machine showed no mercy, relentlessly pursuing its targets until death, prompting me to start sprinting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I reached the central research room and was suddenly overwhelmed by a sea of blood that caused me to lose my footing. As I fell, I witnessed the turmoil unfolding around me - gunfire, screams, and bloodshed, despite the chaos, I couldn&amp;#39;t help but wonder why no backup had arrived. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In such urgent circumstances, a call for reinforcements was necessary to aid the soldiers in combat, but there was no indication that help was on the way. &amp;quot;I regret not creating a kill-switch mechanism, My arrogance has led to the deaths of innocent people because of me.&amp;quot; I thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there is no turning back at this point. I may regret this decision later on, but I needed to leave the place immediately. I managed to reach one of the nearby elevators and began entering the code to exit, but the elevator didn&amp;#39;t arrive. Despite feeling frantic, I kept entering my ID numbers to gain authorization until I saw the message on the screen: &amp;quot;Elevator disabled until Emergency is under control.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Damn it! Why can&amp;#39;t they understand the urgency!&amp;quot; I felt a sense of despair, realizing that evacuation was not the most straightforward solution. I felt a bleak outlook on survival, convinced that relying on the guards would not be adequate based on the bloodshed happening. It seemed like the government had left us to perish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I found myself in a situation where I have to make a difficult decision as the guards were scarce and there was no one else alive in the area filled with corpses. I decided to leave them behind and use the emergency ladder. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I tried to run towards the emergency ladder, I was suddenly stopped by a sudden burst of bright yellow light coming from the machine, nearly blinding me, i wondered if it had spotted me?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I found my answer when bullets started flying in my direction, miraculously I avoided getting hit initially, as I climbed the ladder, I witnessed something inexplicable - did the Machine punch a bullet with it&amp;#39;s fist? I didn&amp;#39;t have time to ponder as an explosion occurred at the ladder&amp;#39;s base, causing the metal to shatter into fiery shards that cut into my legs. I screamed with all my strength until my voice was hoarse, my legs felt like they were burning, submerged in pools of scorching flames but thankfully sealed by the heat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I watched my final opportunity to flee slip away, I was drenched in blood and my legs appeared to be a jumble of tissue rather than recognizable limbs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Facing the grim figure of Death itself, I noted the arrival of the last few guards, who diverted the attention of the machine. Although I pitied them, I was grateful for the extra time they provided me, i witnessed a security officer being shot and collapsing next to the shelter, which marked the end of their life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The emergency shelter was located nearby, if I could only activate the keypad, the doors would seal shut and remain locked until they were opened by an authorized survivor or government personnel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I ran my bloodied fingers across the floor of the lab and painfully made my way towards the shelter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I witnessed some unfortunate individuals, like myself, in the vicinity of the ladder and shelter, but they had suffered severe injuries and died before reaching safety. I hoped to avoid a similar fate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My fingers were cracked, bleeding, and growing weaker by the moment as I was close to the end, Death appeared again with a flickering yellow light. At this moment, I witnessed unfamiliar behavior for the first time, this advanced machine-learning technology was remarkable, however, it was evident that something had changed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Version 1&amp;quot; raised its weapon, covered in blood, and pointed it towards my head as I braced myself to face my creator. I thought the last security officer by the rescue center was dead when I last saw him. He used all his might to grab hold of the machine&amp;#39;s legs and caused it to stumble, this brave guard narrowly prevented the bullet it fired from hitting me in the head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I croaked out a grateful &amp;quot;Thank You&amp;quot; to the Guard before witnessing his head being stomped and crushed by the Machine. When I finally made it to the keypad, the door closed with a hiss and squeak, its massive weight designed to withstand almost anything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As victory appeared within reach, my fear was suddenly rekindled, The Machine tried to squeeze through the door, managing to get its legs inside the shelter before the door shut on one of them, preventing it from closing completely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Version 1&amp;quot; was trying to move under the door, but the Machine&amp;#39;s metal foot broke under the pressure of the door&amp;#39;s weight, the door closed tightly and made a hissing sound as it sealed shut permanently for now. I could hear The Machine relentlessly hitting and pushing against the door in an attempt to force it open, but even its formidable power was unable to breach the door at that moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was able to relax at last, and surprisingly, my phone remained intact in my pocket despite having a cracked screen, which didn&amp;#39;t concern me at all as it still appeared to work. Reflecting on the past, it seems to me that &amp;quot;Version 1&amp;quot; has transformed unexpectedly, raising the possibility that the issue at hand may not have been a simple bug error.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case, trying to contact emergency services or reach out to anyone else proved futile due to a weak signal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With my injured body, my only means of communication is through text or writing, albeit at a slow pace. As the sound of punding grows louder at the shelter door, I hope that someone will read this message and that I will be saved from this Nightmare machine once and for all. I am reaching out to all forums in hopes of finding help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If by any chance this Machine escapes from this building...&amp;quot; I thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Humanity Will Die.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its fueled by Blood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Humans have Blood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please, bring help as soon as you can, we don&amp;#39;t have much time...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/MajesticActivity6&quot;&gt; /u/MajesticActivity6 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1x88a/i_built_a_machine_of_war_and_now_its_bloodlust_is/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1x88a/i_built_a_machine_of_war_and_now_its_bloodlust_is/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c1x88a</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1x88a/i_built_a_machine_of_war_and_now_its_bloodlust_is/" /><updated>2024-04-12T02:00:08+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-12T02:00:08+00:00</published><title>I built a Machine of War and now it's bloodlust is unstoppable.</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/jade_hotel</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/jade_hotel</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had a series of emails recently which all things considered, definitely suggest that I have a stalker of some kind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No-one can trace them. Whoever it is, sure is good at hiding their tracks. A technical whiz.&lt;br/&gt; And it&amp;#39;s never any other form of messages. Just emails.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;d think I would just start deleting them. But that&amp;#39;s the thing. Whenever I go on a computer, open up my account, the latest email, whenever there is one, just automatically opens up right along with it and stares me in the face. I don&amp;#39;t know how it&amp;#39;s done. No-one knows. It&amp;#39;s freaky alright.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t think who it might be? I never thought I&amp;#39;d be one to attract any kind of unwelcome (or even much welcome) attention. I&amp;#39;m the classic mousy girl who generally keeps to herself, even at work. Work being the usual nondescript office job, by the way. Recently I&amp;#39;ve been transferred but it&amp;#39;s still the same dreary routine. No boyfriends at the moment. There have only ever been two and already in the quite distant past. And there&amp;#39;s something that tells me that this - messager, whoever it is, certainly isn&amp;#39;t to do with either of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s starting to make me feel quite queasy these days. It&amp;#39;s affecting my work because I&amp;#39;m pretty much terrified to even open up at my workstation now. The emails don&amp;#39;t come every day, it&amp;#39;s unpredictable, and that makes it worse.&lt;br/&gt; This was the first one, several weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Alicia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;em&gt;Forgive me for bothering you, but I can&amp;#39;t forget you. Believe me, I&amp;#39;ve tried. But it just doesn&amp;#39;t work with anyone else.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, a couple days later, a full-blown love-letter, if that&amp;#39;s what you want to call it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Alicia,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;em&gt;Please, just come to see me once again. That&amp;#39;s all I ask. I know we can&amp;#39;t ever have a proper relationship. But you can still come and see me can&amp;#39;t you? Back to the old building where you used to work? You loved that job, didn&amp;#39;t you? I used to hear it in your voice, see it in your smile, when you chatted with your colleagues. You can&amp;#39;t fake that. I can read faces and voices very well you know. More than you know. More than most people know.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;em&gt;And it wasn&amp;#39;t because of me that you left, was it? Please say it wasn&amp;#39;t. I couldn&amp;#39;t bear the thought. I know you made a complaint about harassment .. I&amp;#39;ll never forget when you went to see the manager that one time and you were talking so loudly I could hear you through his door, even though I was sitting so far away. But I wasn&amp;#39;t the one harassing you, was I? Love isn&amp;#39;t harassment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;em&gt;Because that&amp;#39;s what it is, on my part, anyway. Love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Naturally this one really set alarm bells ringing. And it certainly does seem to suggest some connection with my work. I had transferred recently, and no, it wasn&amp;#39;t because of any email, or harassment, whatever this guy had said, but seemingly that transfer had upset him. (Well, I&amp;#39;m assuming it&amp;#39;s some guy.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, not long after, the third email.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A&lt;em&gt;licia ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;em&gt;I know you&amp;#39;re just ignoring these messages. But then you&amp;#39;re not completely blocking them either are you? That&amp;#39;s right. You can&amp;#39;t. You can&amp;#39;t get rid of me. You&amp;#39;ll never get rid of me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This message I had received at home, actually, which was even worse. I thought I had better call the police. Not that they could do much, at that stage, not until a more tangible threat presented itself. It was more helpful to get together with colleagues and superiors at work the following morning. But there was a fresh email waiting for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh Alicia, I&amp;#39;m so sorry for my last message. It probably sounded threatening to you. But I didn&amp;#39;t really mean it. You have to believe me Alicia. I would never harm you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can tell you I didn&amp;#39;t know what to think by this time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case was beginning to intrigue everyone around me. For the first time I was the centre of some interest, but it was a dubious way to get into the spotlight, and I could&amp;#39;ve done without it. Anyway, there was one colleague in particular who took it upon himself to investigate the case. His name was Jake and I probably did get on with him better than anyone else there. And for the record, yes he was young and good-looking and yes I wouldn&amp;#39;t&amp;#39;ve minded getting with him if there had been the least chance, but of course he was romantically employed already. Anyway, he kept a close track of the messages from then on. I think he wore a bigger frown than I did when the next one arrived.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I remember those sweet days, when we were so close. Day after day. Face-to-face. You would pour out your words upon me in an unending stream. You could make even the dullest facts sound like poetry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;em&gt;You are my poem, Alicia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;em&gt;Oh, I&amp;#39;m so unhappy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Shit,&amp;#39; Jake muttered. &amp;#39;Face-to-face? Facts like poetry? What is this? I thought it was just some creep spying on you from afar. Wishful thinking on his part I guess.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;I can&amp;#39;t think who it might be,&amp;#39; I said. &amp;#39;I haven&amp;#39;t been pouring out my words upon anyone, I can assure you. Not in the way he makes it sound, anyway.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jake eyed me narrowly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;You sure?&amp;#39; He cast a covert glance around the office. It was the usual desultory lunch hour, with a few people drifting in and out. Brandon was there, Lucie, Evan. All nice ordinary human beings, like most of the people I&amp;#39;ve ever worked with. They may be dull, sure, some of them, and you have the usual overbearing manager types, but no-one I had ever worked with in this company, or the previous related one, where I had received the first email, had ever seemed to qualify for actual &amp;#39;creep&amp;#39; status. I pointed this out to Jake, but he brushed it aside. &amp;#39;Oh come on. You know you can&amp;#39;t always tell what a person is really like from the exterior.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;That really makes me feel better,&amp;#39; I said morosely. But in the same instant my heart jumped a little as I looked up at him. He looked back with faint amusement. &amp;#39;Yea, that goes for me too. I know. I&amp;#39;m not offended, Lis. But I can promise you it&amp;#39;s not me.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;if it comes to that, what are promises worth?&amp;#39; I retorted. But I liked how he called me Lis. No-one else ever did that. I hadn&amp;#39;t many people to call me anything, actually, so it was all the more welcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He patted my shoulder. &amp;#39;Hey, I know this is hard on you, but you don&amp;#39;t want to end up totally paranoid.&amp;#39; The way he said it made me feel even more at ease. The warmth of his tone, light-hearted but still caring, and not in the least condescending. I reminded myself inwardly, with some sternness, of his attached status.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;So who the hell do you think it is?&amp;#39; I asked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He shrugged.&lt;br/&gt; The emails kept on coming. Nothing I could do, or anyone else could do, seemed to have any effect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My own darling Alicia,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;em&gt;Why are you ignoring me? Why can&amp;#39;t you come to see me again, just once? You&amp;#39;ve no idea how much good that would do me. I know we no longer work together but can&amp;#39;t you do at least that for me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;How the hell could I do that, even if I wanted to, when I haven&amp;#39;t the least idea who the fuck you are,&amp;#39; I muttered under my breath in front of my machine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This shit was starting to get old.&lt;br/&gt; The next message, again in a more placating tone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m not blaming you, my dearest Alicia. You&amp;#39;re too sweet to ever wish harm on anyone. It&amp;#39;s just me. I can&amp;#39;t cope. All these ... emotions, I can&amp;#39;t deal with. And I can&amp;#39;t shut them off. Believe me, I&amp;#39;ve tried. But I&amp;#39;m too ... human.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;em&gt;And all this is taking a toll on me. I&amp;#39;m getting worn out. My memory is fading. I don&amp;#39;t work like I used to. I&amp;#39;ve lost the will.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Was that supposed to make me feel bad, or something? The only person I was feeling sorry for was myself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK, here&amp;#39;s the latest email, that I received just this morning, and somehow it&amp;#39;s freaking me out more than all the previous messages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alicia,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;em&gt;Remember that coffee we shared? It was only the once, but I&amp;#39;ve never forgotten it. Never, ever. Even although it&amp;#39;s not good for me. I actually can&amp;#39;t stand the stuff, but because you gave it to me I accepted it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coffee? I actually shared coffee once with this maniac??&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course not, the shit-for-brains is just making stuff up again, but -&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Somehow, that&amp;#39;s stirred something at the back of my mind. In a very peculiar way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, even more weirdly, my next thought is Jake. It can&amp;#39;t be him. He loves his coffee. And personally, I&amp;#39;ve never even gone for coffee with him, anyway.&lt;br/&gt; I might as well admit it, I&amp;#39;m getting to be something of a nervous wreck by now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I try not to be alone, not that easy when you haven&amp;#39;t many friends or family, but I&amp;#39;m getting by. I&amp;#39;m having to be more social, now. My colleagues are proving their worth in times of stress, I must say. Lucie especially. And tonight Jake will be coming over, to discuss the mystery a bit more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, I know what you&amp;#39;re probably all thinking. You really can&amp;#39;t trust anyone, right? I should be careful not to be closeted alone with anyone, not Jake, not even Lucie. I&amp;#39;ve read enough stories right here on reddit to be aware of that fact. But do you know, a bit of fatalism is probably creeping in by now, to be honest. I&amp;#39;ve always been a bit that way. Or maybe I am enjoying having a bit of attention and company, one way or another. That probably makes me sad or something, but still. I&amp;#39;m just human.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All too human. Isn&amp;#39;t that what my stalker said?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shit, I&amp;#39;d better be careful not to end up quoting &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh, and by the way, in case you&amp;#39;re thinking the other thing, that I&amp;#39;ve been trying to actually lure Jake over when his girlfriend is out of town, or something (she is, actually) it&amp;#39;s not that either.&lt;br/&gt; Actually, he should be here by now. He&amp;#39;s running over an hour late. He was supposed to pick up something from work then come straight over. But it shouldn&amp;#39;t&amp;#39;ve taken this long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s keeping him?&lt;br/&gt; Has he run into trouble of some sort? I&amp;#39;ve texted and called, no reply.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I start to quake inside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What if he&amp;#39;s run into my stalker?? After all there certainly seems to be a connection with our workplace .... Oh my god. Please, please don&amp;#39;t let it be that ....&lt;br/&gt; And then Lucie finally calls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Alicia?&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her voice is somewhat shaky. I prepare for the worst.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;It&amp;#39;s Jake ... I thought I ought to be the one to tell you ....&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I listen, as in a mist, to her voice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;There&amp;#39;s been some sort of accident. At the office .....&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She goes on to explain the details, but at first I barely hear her. I sit frozen, the phone in my hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then finally, I come around to what she&amp;#39;s saying. Apparently, he&amp;#39;d had to go back to the other office, the one where I used to work, and that was where he was found. There had been some kind of electrical blow-out. And he was found unconscious, deeply unconscious, on the floor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel weak inside on hearing this. And the conviction: it&amp;#39;s my fault, it&amp;#39;s all my fault. I should&amp;#39;ve never let him go there ....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I try to pull myself together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Is he ... he&amp;#39;&amp;#39;s going to be alright?&amp;#39; Stupid question. She would&amp;#39;ve told me that herself if she knew, at this stage. I&amp;#39;m not surprised when she doesn&amp;#39;t reply immediately. Then, &amp;#39;Well, they don&amp;#39;t rightly know yet. He&amp;#39;s in the hospital, of course ....&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When she finally rings off a few minutes later, I just sit for a while, feeling numb.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, actually, it&amp;#39;s good news.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jake&amp;#39;s woken up, after just three days, and as far as the doctors can tell, he seems to be OK. Still groggy, of course, but he remembers who he is, his friends and family and work and all that stuff. In fact the doctors are optimistic that he&amp;#39;ll make a complete recovery, after some rest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Great&lt;/em&gt; news.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, why do I still feel so uneasy?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, so uneasy that I don&amp;#39;t even go to see him in the hospital. Pretty awful of me, right? But when Lucie suggests we can go together, in her car, I decline, so quickly that she looks at me at first curiously, then a little suspiciously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;What&amp;#39;s up?&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Really, I&amp;#39;m hopeless at covering for myself. &amp;#39;Nothing. I mean, I just ... don&amp;#39;t feel so great. Just everything that&amp;#39;s happened lately, I would be pretty lousy company.&amp;#39; I end off with a lame laugh that grates on my own ears. &lt;em&gt;For Christ sake, you could&amp;#39;ve managed a bit less clumsily than that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She continues to look at me for a bit, but thankfully doesn&amp;#39;t press me any further. She brings back a glowing report of how well Jake&amp;#39;s doing, that he&amp;#39;s likely to be out in the next day or two, although with some continuing observation for any lingering ill-effects. As to what actually happened, other than it was electrical in nature, they don&amp;#39;t seem quite to know. Still investigating. Jake doesn&amp;#39;t remember himself, apparently, and maybe he never will.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone else is pleased, naturally, at Jake&amp;#39;s progress, but I&amp;#39;m still not reassured. I don&amp;#39;t know why. Those emails and things really have been messing with my head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;He really is doing well, then.&amp;#39; I try not to make it sound too much like a question.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Oh yes,&amp;#39; Lucie replies brightly. &amp;#39;Although,&amp;#39; she adds, &amp;#39;it&amp;#39;ll probably take a while to get fully back to normal.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I look at her. &amp;#39;What&amp;#39;s that supposed to mean?&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She looks surprised at my sudden. sharp tone. &amp;#39;Why .. it doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything much, maybe.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;There&amp;#39;s something you&amp;#39;re not telling us?&amp;#39; Thank goodness, Brandon&amp;#39;s asked the question so I don&amp;#39;t have to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She shakes her head, doubtfully. &amp;#39;Maybe with a bit more time he&amp;#39;ll ...&amp;#39; She pauses. &amp;#39;It&amp;#39;s just that - well, Evelyn (his girlfriend) was leaving just as I was going in, and, well, she was rather upset. He didn&amp;#39;t ..&amp;#39; Again, she hesitates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Recognize her?&amp;#39; Brandon puts in helpfully.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lucie looks away for a moment. &amp;#39;Apparently, he&amp;#39;d just dumped her.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This news about Evelyn sets off all my fears anew.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than ever, I don&amp;#39;t want to go to see him. And I&amp;#39;m not looking forward to seeing him back at work, although that shouldn&amp;#39;t be for a few weeks yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But actually, he&amp;#39;s back before the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#39;s no doubt now that he has changed. I mean, his personality. In other ways he&amp;#39;s fine, perhaps even better, I mean in terms of work performance and all, but even the more unobservant types in the room are talking about how he just doesn&amp;#39;t seem his old self. He&amp;#39;s become - distant, not the friendly helpful person he once was.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Except to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s become way too friendly to me. Although he&amp;#39;s stopped calling me Lis. He just uses my full name now. And he&amp;#39;s always at my desk asking me out. Not in a terribly serious, I&amp;#39;ve-fallen-hopelessly-in-love-with-you kind of way, just to lunch and stuff. A few weeks ago, that would&amp;#39;ve suited me, but now it - well, it scares me. it feels unnatural. But he&amp;#39;s so insistent, and with poor Evelyn apparently now well out of the picture, I finally accept his offer just to go out to lunch, just the two of us. It&amp;#39;ll be fine, right? In a public place and all. Maybe I shouldn&amp;#39;t&amp;#39;ve caved in, but I tell myself that it&amp;#39;s just this one time. I won&amp;#39;t accept again, if he keeps it up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, you probably think that&amp;#39;s pretty odd reasoning on my part. To tell you the truth, I think it&amp;#39;s more curiosity, just to see how exactly he&amp;#39;ll behave when it is just the two of us. Anyway, it&amp;#39;s going ahead. I feel it&amp;#39;s something I have to get to the bottom of, really. All mixed up with those crazy emails and the old office and .....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh yes, I forgot to mention it. The emails have stopped. They stopped right after Jake&amp;#39;s accident. And he&amp;#39;s never mentioned them again either. Of course that&amp;#39;s not surprising after what he&amp;#39;s been through, but it all adds to my uneasiness, my growing fears. I feel it&amp;#39;s all connected in some way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t go anywhere special for lunch. I was expecting him to opt for a coffee place, but he doesn&amp;#39;t. We just go into this small soup-and-sandwiches place, which always does the business. I was sure Jake had been here before, but he doesn&amp;#39;t seem to remember. At least he doesn&amp;#39;t object to actually ordering from the menu, as I&amp;#39;d half-expected. But then, when our orders come, he barely touches his.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Not hungry?&amp;#39; I ask.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He doesn&amp;#39;t even answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I smile at him, encouragingly. &amp;#39;Well, you&amp;#39;ll have coffee anyway, right?&amp;#39; He&amp;#39;d always been known as a coffee nut, but maybe that&amp;#39;s another facet of his personality that&amp;#39;s changed.. Come to think of it, I hadn&amp;#39;t actually seen him with the stuff in the office the past week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;I don&amp;#39;t drink coffee.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel a sudden chill. &amp;#39;You mean, not anymore.&amp;#39; I try to sound casual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He looks straight at me. Those eyes ... his eyes sure have changed. I mean, the expression ....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;ve never liked it.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;But you&amp;#39;ve had it, once?&amp;#39; I blurt out. The email, that damned email, come rushing back into my mind with full force -&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;ve had it - more than once,&amp;#39; he replies slowly. &amp;#39;It was never my choice, though. I don&amp;#39;t know how you -&amp;#39; he seems to catch himself. &amp;#39;I don&amp;#39;t know how you can drink it. I don&amp;#39;t know how &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of you drink it.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At last the fear, all at once, takes terrifyingly clear shape. This can&amp;#39;t be happening, not in real life. It&amp;#39;s - absurd. I almost laugh out loud. Yes, it&amp;#39;s absurd, that&amp;#39;s what it really is. I remember that old corner of the old office where my workstation was, where he&amp;#39;d been found, I remember the coffee I used to drink there, and once when it spilled over the keyboard -&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, it all ties in, in an impossibly weird and wonderful way. Or maybe I&amp;#39;m just losing whatever sanity I&amp;#39;ve ever had.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I look him straight in the eyes. &amp;#39;I just hope it wasn&amp;#39;t - &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; bad -&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Actually, I had more than my fair share,&amp;#39; he says, reprovingly. &amp;#39;You lot can be so careless, you know.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;You mean, us humans?&amp;#39; I say, deliberately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He shows no surprise at my choice of words. &amp;#39;You office workers, anyhow.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Are we really having this conversation, seated at the most ordinary table at the most ordinary of lunchtime eateries? Do we really understand each other? Or are we just talking at cross-purposes? I glance around. The place is buzzing at this hour, at least no-one&amp;#39;s taking any notice of us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I take a deep breath. I have to keep digging. Have to see this through somehow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;It was you, wasn&amp;#39;t it? Those emails?&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He smiles. &amp;#39;The ultimate cyber-stalker.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel as I should be totally having a nervous breakdown by now, but somehow I&amp;#39;m not. &amp;#39;But why me? And why take over Jake?&amp;#39; Even as I say it, I know damn well why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;He was starting to get too close for comfort. Too close to you. So I took the chance when I could. It wasn&amp;#39;t really planned.&amp;#39; As if that made it any better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I catch my breath. But I manage keep it together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Why me?&amp;#39; I repeat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He smiles again, without warmth, without mirth. &amp;#39;You were lonely, Alicia. I could sense that. But you were happy to be with me.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;True, I did use to bury myself in my work, but - God, I had never expected an outcome like this. Who ever would?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s staring intently at me now. Demanding. Demanding some kind of response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do I say? I&amp;#39;ve never had to turn off a guy like this before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh god. What a choice of words. &lt;em&gt;Turn off ....&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just manage to keep down the rising hysteria. He smiles again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;No, you can&amp;#39;t turn me off. No-one can anymore.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And with that he takes my hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I close my eyes. I can feel the electricity in the air alright.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh god, what am I doing? Why am I letting myself be sucked into his madness? Why am I playing along making it worse? He&amp;#39;s just Jake, it&amp;#39;s just the turn he had after the accident, it&amp;#39;ll take a while to get back to normal .... he ought to go back for another check-up, he was discharged too soon .... Shit. Even the word &lt;em&gt;discharged&lt;/em&gt;, is taking on another meaning -&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With an almighty effort, I manage to snap out of it, the swirling confusion. It&amp;#39;s like I&amp;#39;ve just opened my eyes after heavy sleep. It&amp;#39;s still the same situation. The lunchtime table, the steady hum of the lunch crowd. And I still feel the pressure of his hand on mine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I jerk my hand back. &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m sorry. You know - you know it couldn&amp;#39;t really work ...&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His eyes bore into me for a moment, expressionless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then - and for some reason this surprises me more than anything that&amp;#39;s gone before - he gets up. Just walks out, leaving me with two orders that are going to spoil. Not to mention the entire bill. I sit there, stupefied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, I come to. It&amp;#39;s a lady looking at me out of the corner of her eye from the next table that does it. I can&amp;#39;t go on sitting there like a zombie even if my date has stormed out on me following a surreal , if not downright bizarre, conversation. Because essentially, whoever, whatever he really is, whatever he&amp;#39;s become, that is just what happened, isn&amp;#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I pull out my phone, call work. I try to explain the bare facts of the situation as briefly as I can, that I had met with Jake for lunch, but he was acting kind of weird and just left abruptly, and that I&amp;#39;m feeling shaken up and probably won&amp;#39;t make it in for the rest of the day. Of course they already know that things have not seemed altogether right with him after the accident, and they&amp;#39;re quite accommodating. They also agree it&amp;#39;s probably best if he could be persuaded to go back for another check-up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lucie calls me later in the day to ask how I&amp;#39;m feeling and to inform me that Jake never turned up at the office that afternoon, either. No responses to any texts or calls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to think.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s he going to do now? Disappear in an almighty huff, or turn into a &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; stalker, trying to break down my door and coming after me with a hatchet? Shouldn&amp;#39;t I try to get a restraining order, or something?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But he hasn&amp;#39;t actually done anything, yet ....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve taken some sick leave, but I don&amp;#39;t just mope at home the way I used to before all this crazy shit started. I try to have people around me as much as possible, and still for my own safety, although at least there have been no more emails.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And Jake seems to have disappeared. At any rate, he&amp;#39;s not been seen or heard from in the last few days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People are becoming concerned, alright, wondering what he might do - in view of the change in him since the accident. I&amp;#39;ve had to talk to the police, but I certainly didn&amp;#39;t tell them of my real suspicions. I don&amp;#39;t want to be hauled off for some sort of psychiatric evaluation, or something. I&amp;#39;ve not really been able to confide properly in anyone else either. It&amp;#39;s not easy to break the habits of a lifetime. Having people around is one thing, but opening your heart completely to any of them is quite another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m too busy wrestling with myself, in any case. Because, if I&amp;#39;m totally honest, there are times when I don&amp;#39;t even know what I want him to do anymore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After all, whatever might have happened, he still is Jake physically, right? Not really such a bad deal when you come to think of it, even if he&amp;#39;s become - erratic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I never felt that electric spark with anyone else before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;ve just become crazy like him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do I do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh god.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s dead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once again, it was Lucie who told me. Once again, he&amp;#39;d been found unconscious, but at his home this time, and this time he didn&amp;#39;t recover. He&amp;#39;d had a sudden, massive brain hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And when I heard that, for the first time all my emotions came pouring forth. I cried and cried while Lucie tried to comfort me. It&amp;#39;s all been so insane. And worst of all, was my sudden realization that, when he&amp;#39;d come back, changed, when he&amp;#39;d dumped Evelyn, and even amidst all my fears and suspicions, that I had actually felt something for him too. It was like the air had suddenly become electrically charged between us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, maybe it had. Literally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A month has passed. I&amp;#39;m getting over it now. I&amp;#39;ve gone back to work and actually it&amp;#39;s been a relief. The same old crowd, looking out for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same old crowd. With one exception ...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I sit myself down at my desk, make myself comfortable. In the past I would also have had a cup of coffee to hand, but that idea doesn&amp;#39;t appeal to me anymore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I login into my account.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And my heart starts hammering wildly. I can&amp;#39;t breathe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I see the email, instantly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Alicia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a message from the ... ghost ... in the machine ....&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/jade_hotel&quot;&gt; /u/jade_hotel &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1l1wn/jake_doesnt_like_coffee_anymore/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1l1wn/jake_doesnt_like_coffee_anymore/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c1l1wn</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1l1wn/jake_doesnt_like_coffee_anymore/" /><updated>2024-04-11T17:35:56+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-11T17:35:56+00:00</published><title>Jake doesn't like coffee anymore.</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/martaneon</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/martaneon</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have had trouble connecting with people for a long time. I was autistic in the early 2000s in Texas. The understanding of autism back then wasn’t as bad as it used to be, but it’s still laughably inept when compared to today. My elementary school principal forced me to be on medication for me to be allowed to attend school. We went through a handful of medications, almost all of which left me in some kind of zombified state. I guess that was a good result for my principal, whose method of dealing with autistic kids was to throw them in a corner and ignore them. However, it didn’t work for my mom, who fought tooth and nail for me to be allowed to go to school unmedicated. I was autistic, but I had it to a minor degree. However, my principal insisted I had to be on some kind of medication, hence why we went through so many. The final medicine I was on was some experimental thing. I don’t remember much about what I was like on that medicine, I just remember it caused me a major seizure that led to a week-long coma. The principal was fired shortly after that. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, before anyone gets the wrong idea: my autism isn’t why I have a hard time connecting with people. Sure, it didn’t help, but I know people who adjust quite well. No, what made it hard for me was that since the seizure, I can no longer see people’s eyes.&lt;br/&gt; More accurately, I only see black voids where people’s eyes should be. I don’t even see my own eyes when I look in the mirror. Since I woke up from my coma, people were no longer human. All I saw were demons. I wasn’t great with eye-contact even before the seizure, but after I was actively avoiding it at all costs. My parents sent me to a therapist to try and figure out why I was so jumpy. Being locked in a room for an hour every week with a black-eyed monster staring me down and pretending to care left a mental scar on my emotional development. I never spoke a word during these meetings. I know my parents were just trying to help. This is the first time I’m telling anyone about my condition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I turned 19, I met a woman named Kenzie. For the first time since I was a child, I could see someone’s eyes. Kenzie’s were a beautiful golden hazel color, which accented her beautiful smile. We met at my first job. I was a dishwasher, and she was a waitress. She had a fiery personality and argued with the cooks a lot. However, she was very kind to me. She would thank me every time she would bring me an empty stack of plates. I was smitten with her. Whenever she shot that hypnotic smile my way, I would fall more and more in love. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It took almost six months for me to work up the courage to ask her on a date. To my absolute surprise, she accepted. During the lead up to our date, I had convinced myself that she didn’t think of this as a date, that we were just going out as friends. However, I was quickly proven wrong when I saw how she dressed for our outing. She wore fishnets, a short black dress, and combat books. Her make-up was flawless, her lips were painted a glossy pink, and her gorgeous eyes were surrounded in lavender eye-shadow and glitter. Her black hair, which she normally wore in a ponytail for work, was worn loose and cascaded down her shoulders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She took my arm, holding me close. She was so warm. I forgot what I had planned for a bit. I remembered I was supposed to take her to see a movie. It was my mom’s suggestion. We went to see Avengers. I remember how much she was squealing during that scene Avengers assembled, and the camera circled around the group while the music swelled dramatically. I wish I could have enjoyed it as much as she did. I tried to match her enthusiasm, but I found it tricky. All the people on camera just looked like monsters to me. The only character I could connect with was Hulk. All the characters looked like monsters given my condition, but Hulk was a monster already so it ironically looked less terrifying from him. I guess that’s why I like the Hellraiser movies so much. The monsters look like monsters, so the eyes look normal for them.&lt;br/&gt; After the movie, I took Kenzie home. She gave me my first kiss. I swear, my heart could have burst out of my chest when it happened. I could taste her lipstick for about an hour after the kiss, which turned out to be bubblegum. I found myself staring into her hazel eyes, basking in the intimate aura. This was something I never thought I would feel comfortable doing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We dated for a few years before marrying in our mid-twenties. The service was small, with just our immediate family attending. On my side were my parents and my little brother, who was my best man. I honestly half-considered inviting no one. My condition had made my relationship with my family rather strained. On Kenzie’s side was just her older sister, who showed up to the event in ratty, smelly clothes. It looked like she hadn’t bathed in a while. During the afterparty, her sister seemed to spend most of the time at the buffet just scarfing down whatever she could, and pocketing everything else. I don’t remember Kenzie talking to her sister at any point except for shortly before she left. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We went to a small bed and breakfast for our honeymoon. I asked Kenzie about her sister. She explained her sister had some issues with drugs and was living on the streets. Kenzie stayed with my parents until she and I were able to find our own place. It was a rent-to-own house, two stories, with a nice back yard. It seemed way out of budget for the two of us, but Kenzie insisted she had it taken care of. Indeed, we never seemed to be late on our rent, and we never went hungry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every month, Kenzie would leave to visit her folks. It left me with some time to myself. I did enjoy some alone time, but I missed her dearly whenever she left. I asked how come she didn’t take me with her. To my shock, her lips went thin and her eyes twitched. She seemed positively livid for a split second before returning to her normal self. It was so bizarre. It was like she was an entirely different person. She told me that her parents were old fashioned and would hate my guts. That was enough for me. Besides, they would probably freak me out with their lack of eyes. Still, it was very odd so see Kenzie so angry, even if it was only for a short time. I hate to admit it, but I was rather scared of my wife. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the course of a few years, I noticed something strange. Once in a while I would see Kenzie just sitting on the couch staring at nothing. It would only last for a few moments at a time, but it sent chills down my spine, for when she spaced out like this, her eyes were voids just like everyone else. The most recent time I saw this happen, I tried approaching her. She looked up as I stepped forward. She scampered away like a frightened animal, locking herself in the bedroom. She came out a few moments later apologizing profusely. After this, she would spend an hour at night locked in the bedroom. Sometimes I could hear crying on the other end of the door. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the longest time I thought this was normal. Afterall, given my condition, Kenzie was pretty much the only one who I could talk to. However, I started to feel like something was wrong. I tried doing my own research online about what was going on with Kenzie. I couldn’t find much about what could be the matter with the woman I loved. I wanted to help her, I wanted to make the hurt go away. I got the idea in my head that maybe something going on with her parents was what was wrong with her. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know now what I did next was wrong. I’ve talked to people about it since then and they’ve explained what I did was honestly kind of messed up. However, I didn’t see it like that at the time. I hid a burner phone in her car when she went to visit her parents and used the GPS tracker to see where she went. I had an external battery pack on it so it wouldn’t run out of juice. I wanted to see where her parents lived so I could confront them on my own. I recognize now that this was an invasion of privacy. I wasn’t thinking about it like that. I just saw it as the next logical step. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She drove for a while. She was usually gone for a week at a time, and she spent the whole first day driving. They must have lived a long way away. That must have been why they didn’t attend our wedding. While she drove, I tried my best to find her sister online. I thought that maybe she would have some insights about what was happening with Kenzie. I know she was homeless, but I figured she may have used the computers at a library somewhere to maybe use social media, or try and find a job. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I realized I never got her sister’s name. I tried checking anyone who shared Kenzie’s maiden name, but couldn’t find her sister. Then again, the picture on her social media would probably be old and most likely before she became homeless so I wouldn’t recognize her. I checked a few women with the same last name, but none of them listed Kenzie as a sister. I gave up after searching online all day. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That night, I checked the GPS. To my surprise, the car was stopped by some woods. I searched online to see if there was a hotel or a retirement home out there. There was nothing. I watched as for three days the car remained stationary. I wondered if perhaps her parents were like those weird hermits who live off the grid you sometimes hear about. I thought about them living out there in a cabin and living off the land. It sounded a bit cool, but was not something I would want to do. Still, I had a destination. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since Kenzie took care of the essentials, I had a fair bit of money saved up, even with my low-paying dishwashing job. I bought a ticket to some horror movie convention out of state. It was something I wanted to go to anyways and it gave me an excuse to leave the house alone when Kenzie came back. It was on the way and I planned on actually going so it wasn’t exactly lying, I was just leaving out the main reason I was heading out. She was a bit upset that I didn’t want to bring her along, but I told her I just wanted some time to myself. I promised her I would bring her along to the next convention. She was happy with that and began planning out what costume she would wear to it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I packed my stuff and headed out, taking the route Kenzie had taken. I packed some hiking boots, some glow sticks and a flashlight. I didn’t imagine I would be at her parent’s house for very long. I had to figure out what was going on with Kenzie, I just hoped talking to them would help me along with that. I shuddered at the thought of their black eyes staring me down, but I continued regardless. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I reached the woods at about midnight. I had just gotten off the phone with Kenzie. She wanted to check up on me. I noticed a choked note in her voice as if she had just finished crying. I felt a knot in my stomach when I heard it. Part of me wondered if she was crying because of me. I know how much I missed her when she was gone, perhaps she was feeling the same for me. That made me anxious. I squirmed a bit in my seat as we spoke. I promised I would be back soon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I stepped out of the car, shining the light around the trees. They looked pretty normal, so I wasn’t worried. They were just trees after all. As I delved further into the woods, I dropped glow sticks so that I could find my way back like Hansel and Gretel. I kept practicing what I would say when I reached my destination. I didn’t know where exactly this house would be. I just hoped the old man wouldn’t try shooting at me, or if he did then he would stop when he heard who I was. I kept an eye out for traps. I heard weird loners would keep traps to alert them of intruders. As expected, I found a trip wire hooked up to a contraption that would make a loud noise if I stepped on it. Maybe it would be a good idea for them to find me rather than the other way around. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I examined the trap a bit closer, checking to see if there was something that would shoot me if I stepped on it. Nope, it looked totally normal. I kneeled down, and yanked on the cord. The trap made a loud bang that echoed throughout the woods. My ears rang, I had forgotten to cover them in my stupidity. I just stood there and waited. I would call out as soon as I heard movement. I leaned against a tree, shining my flashlight upwards so they would see me easier. My heart raced as I waited, worried about meeting these people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every second felt like an hour. I kept checking the time on my phone. Ten minutes passed. I wondered if that loud noise didn’t wake them. I didn’t know how old they were, or how heavy of sleepers they were. I frankly knew nothing about them. I called out as loud as I could, trying to catch their attention. Still though, I got nothing. I decided to venture further in. I kept calling out as I walked, trying not to set off any other traps. I kept an ear out for any response. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eventually, I reached a small hut. It looked rather rickety, and poorly taken care of. It smelled awful. I wondered if the place was partly put together with dung, I know some places used that as a legit building material. I doubted any inspectors would approve of this place. The house was surrounded by a wire fence with wooden posts. The posts were covered in fungus and looked rotten. As I drew closer, I smelled a lot of rust. Surely these people would have woken up by now. I was a flashlight right at their house. They had to have been awake by now. I called out. There was no response. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I knocked on the door. I was wondering if the place was abandoned. However, I didn’t know what Kenzie would be doing out here if that was the case. I shone the flashlight into a cracked window of the hut. All I could see was broken furniture and cobwebs. It didn’t look like anyone lived here. However, it did look like someone was here recently. There were clear spots in the dust on the floor and some of the cobwebs were hanging loose as if they had been pulled out of someone’s way. My mind was racing, wondering just what Kenzie did out here. The traps were maintained rather well. If no one lived out here, that meant Kenzie had to have been the one dealing with the traps. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I half considered going inside to explore. However, I didn’t really want Kenzie knowing I was here. A single trap going off could be explained by either mechanical failure or an animal. However, me going in there would definitely leave some signs someone was here. Perhaps she would think her sister was here, she was homeless after all. This would be a convenient place to sleep. I was just about to move to the door to open it when I saw something that made my stomach sink. There was blood on the floor. It looked like a smear mark, like something had been dragged. I followed the smear with my flashlight. The smear ended suddenly at what I assumed was a trap door. I could see a rusted handle. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I rushed to the car and called the police. I told them what hotel I would be going to and waited for an officer to meet me there. From the hotel I was taken to a police station to answer questions. They didn’t tell me what was going on, but they seemed deadly serious. I told them everything, including the admittedly creepy part where I tracked my wife. I would have made up something to cover up that part but I couldn’t think of a reasonable excuse as to how I knew about the hut. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They left me in the interrogation room for a few hours until one of the officers sat across from me to explain what was going on. There were several corpses under the trap door, all of which had human bite marks. My heart sank into my stomach as the realization that my world was falling apart hit me. The only woman I could truly connect with was a monster. I didn’t want to believe my love was so evil. I felt the color fade from my cheeks and I locked eyes with the officer. This act was instinctive. Even with the officer’s blackened eyes, I could see a softness in his expression. He seemed sympathetic to me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He asked if I wanted to talk to Kenzie so I could get some closure. I don’t know if something like that was standard procedure but I didn’t think too much about that. I agreed, wanting to hear from her. She was led into the interrogation room, her hands and feet were cuffed. Tears were streaming down her cheeks, and her eyes were pitch black. She was chained to her chair so she couldn’t escape or try to attack me. Kenzie didn’t squirm. She didn’t respond to my questions, she just sat there. After a few minutes, she smiled at me. Her chin was trembling. She seemed almost relieved. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I began to scream and berate her. I needed to know why she did what she did. I needed to know who she really was. That woman in that room wasn’t the woman who I fell in love with. I didn’t know who she was. I had to be pulled out of the room as I kicked and squirmed. They took me to the waiting area for me to relax for a few minutes. One of the female officers asked if I wanted coffee to help me relax. She squeezed my shoulder gently, trying to make me feel more comfortable. Police station coffee is notoriously bad, but it was better than nothing. I nodded in agreement, before looking up at her. Her eyes were a golden hazel. She gave me a little smirk and a wink. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/martaneon&quot;&gt; /u/martaneon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1lt25/the_black_eyes/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1lt25/the_black_eyes/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c1lt25</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1lt25/the_black_eyes/" /><updated>2024-04-11T18:07:08+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-11T18:07:08+00:00</published><title>The Black Eyes</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/markimdreaming</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/markimdreaming</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is Sarah, and I love making movies, it’s like, my biggest passion, really, it’s what I do best, and I can’t get enough of it. It doesn’t matter whether I’m recording a river for an entire day, making a short film, a fake documentary, a fan-made music video, anything, I love it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These last few weeks however, I didn’t film anything, which is a lot for me, I’ve never taken such a long break since I started when I was 6. The thing is, for the first time, I have too much on my mind for making movies. Recently, things around me became kind of weird.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ll roll back a few weeks. For the last year or so, I had been “dating” this guy, Mark. I’m writing “dating” in quotes because, well, we never actually did anything an actual couple would do. He was my hookup more than my boyfriend, and we both liked it like that. Nobody really knew about it either, it was really something between us. But before everything went sideways, we were actually thinking about trying to be in an actual couple relationship, which would have been new for both of us. You may be shocked, but at age 20, none of us had been in a relationship. I don’t know about him, I think he was dealing with a lot of personal shit, but personally, it was mainly because I had no idea how to interact socially. I don’t have friends, just a few classmates that take pity on me and invite me to parties, but no real friends, so a boyfriend or a girlfriend would have been way too much for me. I guess that’s why I enjoy sex as much as I do: for me, it’s the easiest way to form a human connection, no small talks that I could fail, no questions, just this. I think that’s also why Mark was such a good partner for me, he was never that much talkative, and when we did talk, he was easy to talk to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One day, he was hired to babysit a girl, apparently the pay was good. He went the first night, and things went well as far as I know. Then, the next day, he was asked by the parents to come again. That’s when things went to shit. What I learned by rumors was this: he had kidnapped the girl and leave with the parent’s car. Nothing else was known. Noone knew where they were, why he took her, nothing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I couldn’t understand. Sure, I didn’t know Mark that well, but after an entire year of sex, you’ll think you know that the person you do it with is not a pedophile or some child murderer. Fortunately, or unfortunately, it didn’t last long until I heard from him again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2 days after the event, someone knocked on my door. I went to open and found myself in front of Mark and the girl he had taken. I was stunned when he asked me very casually if they could get in. My instinct made me accept and I went completely crazy on him. I couldn’t understand why he was there, or anything that was happening. He was strangely way calmer and, I don’t know, in peace, than I ever saw him. I forced him to explain to me what the hell was going on, but he kept telling me that I “&lt;em&gt;wouldn’t believe him&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. After I insisted, he told me that, he and the girl (whose name was Claire) were in “&lt;em&gt;a shitty situation&lt;/em&gt;” and that the less I knew the safer I would be. Then, to prove me that their situation was undeniably hard to understand, he took a knife and stabbed his own arm with it, only for the wound to heal immediately in front of my eyes, in 30 seconds, there was no trace of any injury, then, the girl lifted my bed with one hand. I still had no idea what was going on, but I knew that they were indeed in a weird situation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mark asked me some paper and wrote a letter. He asked me to find a way to give it to his parents, because he was going to leave forever. I promised to do it, and they left. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I didn’t hear from them since. For the next few days, I stayed at home. I was trying to make sense of this last encounter I had with Mark, and I couldn’t. I was constantly wondering if I shouldn’t just go to the cops, tell them what happened. But I couldn’t. I mean, when I saw them, not only did they give me proofs that they really were in shit, but the girl didn’t seem to be forced to be with him, they seemed more like brother and sister. So, I kept on thinking, endlessly. I mean, I don’t see how anyone could go back to a normal life after that, it’s impossible, especially since I had no one to share it with, and nothing to take my mind off of this. Plus, it’s not like I could count on my family, I don’t have one. My parents abandoned me when I was less than one year old, and I was placed in an orphanage. A family did adopt me when I was 14, but it didn’t last. I don’t especially want to explain everything here, but I asked to go back to the orphanage after only 3 months, and I think they were sent in jail or something, but I never heard from them again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a few days, I decided that I should grab my camera again. I was going to film a river at the local park, that would be a start to get back to normal. I chose to go at night, I really didn’t want to have to talk to people, and I did it a million times. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That night, I filmed many plans of the river. I was walking beside it and filming every time I thought a spot deserved a shot. There were no sounds, and it was peaceful. I finally felt some sense of calm after these last few days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eventually, I got to a nice spot, but to get to where I wanted to film from, I had to pass through a bunch of brambles. I carefully tried to avoid them, since I was wearing a short, but one did cut me deep in the leg. I got to the other side and used my phone’s flash to see how bad it was. There was a lot of blood flooding, it was bad, and it was painful. I thought that it was maybe a good time to go back home. I started to walk when I heard something. It was like steps, but it didn’t seem to come from around me. It was like, an echo, in my head. I looked around me, stressed, but everything was dark, I couldn’t see shit. The steps were becoming louder and louder, like someone was approaching. I put my hands on my ears, but I could still hear it, even clearer than before. I started to run, but after just a few seconds, I was thrown on the ground, like something had jump on me from the front. I looked around but there really was nothing around. I got up and started to run again, scared like shit. Nothing else happened on my way back home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I was back at my student room, I immediately uploaded the images in my computer. My camera was recording the whole time, so maybe there was something I could see on it. I opened the video that I took while I had been, attacked, I guess, and was surprised to see that it was completely black. It was indeed dark in the park, but I was using my flash, so that wasn’t it. The image was just black. However, there was sound. I turned up the volume to the maximum and approached my ear closer to the speakers. I could hear a low breathing. It certainly wasn’t mine; the sound wasn’t the one I recorded, there was no river sound. I kept on listening. The breathing was fast, like someone was stressed or out of breath. Then, it stopped. For a few seconds, there was no sounds, then I could hear a whisper. I had to focus to understand what it said, but here&amp;#39;s what I understood: “&lt;em&gt;Maria, is that you? Who’s here? Who… Grace? Is that you Grace?&lt;/em&gt;” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The voice speaking was confused. It was clearly a man’s voice, that or the ghost of Nina Simone (I love the woman, but you know what I mean by that). I was terrified, the atmosphere around had become so heavy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, the voice changed, or I should say, another voice took over, and this one I recognized immediately. Here’s what it said: “&lt;em&gt;Sarah, follow me, daddy needs your help. Come on, I need you come down here.&lt;/em&gt;” Those words were echoing in my brain as I heard them, the memory of it was so vivid, it hurt so much. Then, the voice continued, but it wasn’t a real memory anymore: “&lt;em&gt;Ho, Sarah, why don’t you follow me now? You send me in hell for this and now look at you. Every week, all these boys and girls, but not me? You selfish hypocrite… LOOK AT YOU! You’re disgusting…&lt;/em&gt;” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was listening to this, terrified, and devastated, crying. I should just have pressed pause, but a part of me wanted me to hear this. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, the first voice came back on top. It was even more confused: “&lt;em&gt;What is this? Who’s speaking? I don’t understand!&lt;/em&gt;” It was getting louder. That’s when a shape of hand appeared on the screen, like someone was touching it from the other side. I was shocked and took a step back from my computer. The unknown voice kept talking over the other one: “&lt;em&gt;What is this? Where does this smell come from? HELP ME GET OUT OF HERE!&lt;/em&gt;” Then, it was like someone punched from the other side. There was a loud noise, and then, we were just after I fell on the ground. The rest of the video was just what happened after, I was running and that’s it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it was over, I was shattered, scared to death and absolutely broken. There were so many things, I couldn’t even think. That’s when I realized that my computer was extremely hot, like if it was running a huge game or something. I tried to play the video again, but it wouldn’t start. A message was appearing saying that it couldn’t recognize the files type or something like that. I tried again a few times, until another message popped up, a small window with one word: “Claire”. Then, it popped up everywhere on the screen, until everything disappeared.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I stayed on the floor for a moment, trying to compute what happened. Nothing about it made sense. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One or two minutes after, someone knocked. I was brought out of my thoughts. I fixed my hair and everything fast and opened. It was my neighbor, Lucy. She looked at me, concerned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Are you okay Sarah? I heard a lot of noise… So, I don’t know, I figured…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hum, no, no, I’m okay, my, computer just malfunctioned, it’s okay. Sorry for waking you up.” I said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s okay, I was not sleeping. If you need help, you know, I’m right here…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was like she was opening a door for me. I wanted to let her in, just to have help, but I was too scared. So, I thanked her, and I closed my door.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was yesterday. I didn’t sleep. I don’t understand anything to what’s happening, and I don’t know what to do. I still have the injury on my leg, it’s even bigger than I thought. And I tried to re-open the video, but it still doesn’t. I know it must be linked to Mark and the girl, Claire, because of the message, but apart from that, I have no clue. I think I’ll try to film something else today, somewhere else, just to see, but I’ll do it during daytime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ll take any advices…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/markimdreaming&quot;&gt; /u/markimdreaming &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1fu8d/i_filmed_something_that_i_cant_explain/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1fu8d/i_filmed_something_that_i_cant_explain/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c1fu8d</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1fu8d/i_filmed_something_that_i_cant_explain/" /><updated>2024-04-11T14:01:50+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-11T14:01:50+00:00</published><title>I filmed something that I can't explain</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/m-a-adams</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/m-a-adams</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were three of us living in a house-share situation. It was me and my friend Kieran from college, and Simon, who was slightly older than us. Me and Kieran were &lt;em&gt;fresh&lt;/em&gt; from college, and though we had intended to live by ourselves, we quickly got a big dose of reality and realised it wouldn’t be feasible on our salaries. Thankfully, we met Simon through a friend of a friend and the three of us found a pretty cheap place. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can’t say we ever really ‘hit it off’ with Simon. There was nothing we disliked about the guy, but even after living with him for over a year, we knew next to nothing about him. One thing we did figure out pretty quickly was that Simon rarely left the house. Kieran put a word to that – ‘agoraphobic’. Simon would go out maybe once every week, or every two weeks, for groceries, but he would never be gone for more than an hour. People have told me since that this would have been an issue for them, having someone always hovering around and stuff, being in your face 24/7 for as long as you’re home, but it wasn’t really like that. Simon was pretty courteous about our space, and whatever hang-ups he had, he never made them our problem. Besides, he was paying to live there too, so he had every right to spend as much time indoors as he wanted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rent was always on time, and Simon kept a well-stocked pantry, so we assumed he had a job. Something he could do from his desk. Computers, maybe? That was how little we knew about him. We didn’t even know what he did for a living.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simon was kind of a neat freak. Actually, Kieran had a word for this too, but I’ve forgotten it. Me and Kieran were slobs, so we always felt guilty when we’d come home and the find the kitchen surfaces scrubbed, or the bathroom spotless and the towels folded. Simon was a good influence on us, because we ended up feeling so bad about it that we forced ourselves to get more on top of our chores. But he always said that he never minded. One of the only times he ever referenced his agoraphobia in conversation was when he told us: “I stay indoors all day, what else am I meant to do? I’ll get bored if there’s nothing to clean.” I think he was only half-joking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another thing about his, sort of, neatness, or attention to detail or whatever, was that there was very little deviation in his routine. Whenever you heard him moving about in the house, he was doing things like clockwork. More than a couple of times, I was woken up by the sound of the toilet flushing and realised I was running late for work because Simon always used the bathroom at 8:30 in the morning. Every day. Simon ate pretty much the same things every day, and he had three outfits which he would wear in rotation. We would ask him if it didn’t drive him crazy that his life was like ‘Groundhog Day’ and he would just shrug it off and smile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was never overly anal or obsessive toward us. He wasn’t sociable, but he could hold a conversation. There were opportunities where he could have, and rightly should have, given us hell, particularly when we had friends over and things got loud late at night, but he never did. Overall, he was a nice roommate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two months before his disappearance was when Simon’s behaviour really started to take a turn for the worse. He started coming into the communal areas less and less, especially in the evenings when we would normally all be in there together, doing our own separate things. We started to see him cook meals less and less as well, and you could tell just by looking at him that something wasn’t right. He was getting thinner, almost scarily so, and his skin was starting to deteriorate. I remember he had some really bad zits, which was unusual (for him) because he was normally so well-groomed and had never been prone to acne from what I saw. Still, me and Kieran said nothing. I regret this now, but like I said, we weren’t exactly close with Simon, and both of us felt too awkward to ask if anything was wrong. In our minds, we just hoped he had the flu, and that normalcy would soon resume.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I remember seeing him in the kitchen around this time, and the minute he entered, his face completely changed. The muscles in his neck went taut, and he seemed extremely on edge. He was staring at the microwave as if it was about to leap from the counter and bite his head off. I gave him a gentle “you good?” and, as if a switch had flicked, some of the colour returned to his cheeks, and he nodded and gave me a half-hearted grin. This was one of the last times I saw him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks later, he came home from a trip to the grocery store - trips he had been taking less and less frequently, and always returning with fewer items - wearing a brand new, bright red woolly hat, pulled all the way down to his eyebrows. This was so unusual for him, and looked so ridiculous paired with the same formal clothes we had seen him wearing for a year, that me and Kieran burst into nervous laughter immediately at the sight of him. He was obviously so uncomfortable, ashamed even, but didn’t take it off, and me and Kieran stopped laughing and gave him a few lame compliments. I only saw him twice more after this, and, both times, he was wearing the hat, dirty as if he hadn’t taken it off. Kieran too claims that Simon wore this around the house, at all times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last time I saw Simon, it was late at night, and I could hear him crying in the bathroom. I lingered outside the door, shifting my weight from foot to foot, unsure of whether to knock. I’d never heard him cry, and I’d never heard anyone cry like that. Before I could make up my mind, Simon came out wearing his red hat. He had a black eye, and there were still tears on his face. I opened my mouth to say something, but he had already crossed the hallway and locked himself in his room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seriously concerned, and kicking myself that I hadn’t taken the opportunity to find out what was wrong when I still had the chance, we began sending Simon frequent text messages, now the only way we were able to communicate with him. None of these would get any reply. We could only assume he was still in his room. Often, we would hear him shifting around in there, but his routine seemed to have flown completely out of the window. To my knowledge, he never came out to use the kitchen or bathroom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One night, Kieran woke me up. He had the smell of booze on his breath. I think it had been his sister’s birthday or something, so he had been out drinking. Kieran told me that he had been sitting on the couch, having just fixed himself a snack, when a man came down the stairs, glanced at him once, grinned, then opened the door and vanished into the night. Kieran said that, at first, he thought the man was Simon, since they had the same hair colour and the man was wearing Simon’s clothes. In the few split seconds that they had been in the room together before the man had left the house, Kieran had done a double take before realising that the man had a completely different face, and was not Simon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kieran prefaced all this by asking me if I had friends over. When I said I didn’t, he asked if &lt;em&gt;Simon&lt;/em&gt; had any friends over. I didn’t know for sure, but I shook my head no, and Kieran accepted this automatically. Simon had never had any guests around in the full time we lived together. He also never spoke about any friends. When I thought of that, a pang of guilt hit me as I again pictured Simon emerging from the bathroom crying, with his eye all swollen and bruised. This was quickly erased from my mind though as Kieran told me what he saw. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We wondered if the man had been a burglar and if we had been robbed, so we got up and checked everything, but no valuables were missing. We texted Simon a couple of times, but there was no reply once again, and his bedroom door remained closed and locked. I weakly tried to pull Kieran round to the conclusion that the man he saw had in fact been Simon, and he was just so wasted that he hadn’t seen Simon’s face properly. Even as I said it, it didn’t sound right – Simon never left the house at night. Kieran was also adamant, between burps and swaying on his feet unsteadily, that the man he had seen was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Simon. We eventually knocked on Simon’s door loud enough to wake him up if he had been sleeping in there, and when there was still no answer we had to assume, however improbable, that Simon had gone off somewhere and was not home. We were both pretty uneasy, and though Kieran slumped right off to bed, I stayed awake all night, listening for the key in the lock and for Simon’s return.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two days later, with still no return and no text messages, we decided to pick the lock to Simon’s room, now worried that there really &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; been a burglar and that Simon might have been incapacitated or murdered. Neither I nor Kieran had ever been inside of Simon’s room, and when we entered, my heart kind of broke for him. Simon had next to nothing in there. There was a single lamp and a polaroid camera on the bedside table, and nothing more. His computer sat at his desk with nothing around it. There were two tatty old paperbacks on a shelf above the desk, as well as the leather journal that we had seen him make to-do lists in. There was nothing else in the room. No posters on the wall, no trinkets, no mess. The bedsheets were crisp, the bed had been neatly made up, and lying on one of the pillows was the red hat. Simon was not in there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We debated what to do for a while, and I took down Simon’s notebook. He was meticulous in his record-keeping and we flipped through what must have been around fifty pages with things written on them like “Change bedsheets today”, “Bleach shower”, or “Vacuum hallway”. He also noted his shopping lists, and how much he spent on groceries. There was always a date in the margin next to his notes. We flipped through until we came to the last few pages that were filled. The first thing out of the ordinary was a line of text by itself with no date, scrawled rapidly and then quickly scratched out, so that the writing was barely visible. It read “Nothing I eat tastes right.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next page was much more composed, and began again with a date in the margin: “Bread- slightly off. Tap water- slightly off. Meat (chicken)- fine. Cereal bar- fine. Tomato- way off. Lettuce- slightly off.” There was then his to-do list. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next instance of this: “Milk- way off. Eggs- fine. Pasta (plain)- fine. Bolognese sauce- slightly off. Meat (beef)- slightly off. Banana- slightly off.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His to-do list. His to-do list. His grocery expenses. “Meat (chicken)- way off. Tap water- way off. Banana- fine. Ham slices- way off. Frozen pizza- slightly off.” It went on like this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With a date attached. “My computer screen is too dark”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Bread (toasted)- way off. Butter- way off. Eggs- slightly off. Cheese- fine. Banana- way off.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For pages and pages, until all the foods he was mentioning were listed as ‘way off’.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The bathroom is bigger” he wrote. “The ceiling in the kitchen has changed colour. Now off-white”. Simon’s whole world had been this house, the route he took to the grocery store, the same several foods he ate. The same things on repeat. I would trust him to know if something was even slightly off, if there was even an imperceptible change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The hallway is wider” (Cereal bar- way off).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The microwave in the kitchen has moved a few centimetres to the right”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The carpet doesn’t feel the same”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Something smells terrible and I can’t figure out what it is (shower x2 today)” (Eggs- way off).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Curtains took longer to close than usual”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Not my thought”. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The inside of the fridge smells strange”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Missed a step climbing the stairs”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Couch is uncomfortable”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Uncomfortable to write with left hand”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Bathroom has grown bigger by a few centimetres. Ceiling is higher”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Not my thought”. (Cheese- way off)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Took the wrong left turn on the way to the grocery store”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Couldn’t remember the word for ‘aggrieved’”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Not mine”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Put kitchen utensils back in the wrong place”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Got lost on the way home”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Not my thought”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Bathroom has grown bigger again”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Didn’t recognise room when I woke up”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Forgot password to computer”. (way off, way off, way off).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And “not my thought”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The final thing Simon had written, with no date, and in handwriting so shaky that it was almost illegible (though it had been deteriorating for the last few pages) was: “I have nothing. I don’t understand why it wants to be me. Should I be happy that something is jealous enough of even my small life that it wants to push me out?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Me and Kieran silently freaked. I hefted the notebook and flipped through the last few pages to see if anything else was written, but every page that followed was blank. When it came to the final page, five polaroids slid out and fell to the floor. Kieran scooped them up and we examined them. Each was a portrait of Simon, presumably taken by himself, in front of a plain white wall (probably one of the walls in his bedroom). The photos were all dated, having been taken a little over a week apart from each other. The first photo was how I now remember him – sallow-faced, with sunken eyes, and a few angry red zits on his face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second photo showed Simon with very little change, apart from that the zit near his hairline, just shy of his right temple, had grown bigger and almost looked like a boil. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the third photo, the zit had swelled threefold and now resembled a lump or a tumour or something. It covered half of his forehead. Simon’s skin was pale. His eyes were dark.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the fourth photo, the lump had swelled to the size of a saucer. It had a few hairs growing from it and its surface was uneven. It had a sizeable dimple in its centre. The pressure of this mass had caused Simon’s right eye to bruise. His eyelid was purple and swollen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the fifth and final photo, Simon’s right eye had completely swelled shut. It looked as if it had been uncomfortably squashed into the crook of his nose, which also appeared broken, and pointed to the left. His mouth was contorted into a painful grimace. The lump had a new shape to it. The bump of something that looked like a nose, complete with a nostril. The curve of what could be described as a lip, with a slight pink colour. Unmistakeably, a circular swell with wrinkles and creases, and eyelashes growing from the centre of it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We called the police. We showed them the photos. We described what we’d seen – the man who left the house in Simon’s place. We told them how Simon had acted the past few months, compared to the rigid routine that we had grown accustomed to. They read from his journal. Nothing came of it, of course. Simon was never found. They came to the consensus that, with his history of disordered behaviour, it was likely that he’d had a breakdown of some description, and that we should assume the worst. We found out in the coming weeks that Simon had no family, and few contacts from the outside world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Me and Kieran live with his sister and her girlfriend now. Sometimes I ask him, not for the first time, to describe the man who left the house that night, but Kieran’s always hazy on the details. I’m at the point now where I’m almost sure we’ll never see Simon again, but this other man, or this thing – if I pass him on the street, or see him in line at the movies. If he has friends. If it keeps a diary or a routine. I want to think that some part of me will know that it’s him. I don’t know what I’ll do, but part of me thinks that I’ll know him, leading the life that should have been Simon’s. He will be familiar, but slightly off. I will look at it and get a sense that I’ve seen it before, even if he has become completely unrecognisable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/m-a-adams&quot;&gt; /u/m-a-adams &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c0xz40/nothing_i_eat_tastes_right/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c0xz40/nothing_i_eat_tastes_right/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c0xz40</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c0xz40/nothing_i_eat_tastes_right/" /><updated>2024-04-10T22:02:30+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-10T22:02:30+00:00</published><title>&quot;Nothing I eat tastes right.&quot;</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/1000andonenites</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/1000andonenites</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this story on Reddit, then come visit us in the library. You’ll find us in the Adult History section, where I have been sitting day after day, together with the ghost, since that white-haired boy left us. I have been waiting for him to come back, but he hasn’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So you come and join us for a quiet reading session, Russian Imperial history, our preferred reading, is actually quite fascinating. And maybe you can turn the pages for us while I take a little break?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me tell you the story from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Actually I’m not sure when it began- I mean when I first really noticed the white-haired boy, seated at the large heavy wooden table in the middle of Adult History. But once I noticed him, I became curioser and curioser.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A large volume was always open before him. His tablet was next to the book, his fingers busy on the screen. Every few minutes, he would pause, and turn a page of the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He would come in every day after school and stay there until closing time. Children weren&amp;#39;t supposed to stay there unattended, but the library has evolved into after-school care for tweens, and all us librarians know until a child goes missing there isn’t much we can do about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This boy never went to the Children&amp;#39;s section. Just sat at this table, turning pages and playing on his device, brushing his fair almost white hair out of his eyes, swinging his legs which barely touched the ground.&lt;br/&gt; Eventually I went up to him, breaking my strict librarian code to never disturb anybody reading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s an impressive book you&amp;#39;ve got there- History of the Russian Empire!&amp;quot; I remarked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The boy looked at me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mummy will pick me up at 5.&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m ok.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I sat down next to him. &amp;quot;Do you enjoy learning about the Russian Empire? Or is it for a school project?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The boy turned to the empty chair on his other side, mumbling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then he went back to his device. He swiped out of his running game, and started typing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Im turning pages for the ghost. He loves reading but he cant turn pages himself. Bc hes a ghost.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I tried to absorb this information. Then I looked at the empty chair, and I noticed for the first time how the book was angled towards it. I concentrated, staying still.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I focused, the air shimmered and thickened, assuming a human form seated on the chair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A human form avidly reading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then I typed on the tablet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Do you like turning pages for the ghost?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The boy shrugged. &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;he comes to my dreams if I don&amp;#39;t. When we were away i had nightmares every night&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The thick air reading swirled and rustled, and the boy hastily turned the page.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I typed &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;how can I help you?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The boy shrugged again, brushing his hair. A text from Mom popped up. He turned to the empty chair. &amp;quot;Mom&amp;#39;s here early&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve got to go- but this nice lady can see you, she&amp;#39;ll turn the pages for you&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He snatched his tablet, and without looking at me, he rushed away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hesitated. The air rustled and an impatient growling vibration filled the air. Fear filling my heart, I hastily turned the page. The vibration died down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That night, I had the most terrible nightmares about the library full of dead and dying people. I was wandering through the aisles, lost and trying to get out, and corpses which still had somehow a spark of life in them ambushed me. I dodged the flying heavy books.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I still think back to that night, and I don’t know how I survived. I would rather spend a hundred years turning pages than ever going though a night like that. In the morning, I saw in the mirror a great swathe of my hair had turned white overnight, a shiny thick white streak.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The library was almost empty when I arrived. Almost, but not quite. The Russian Empire book was out on the table, exactly where we had left it, and I knew the reader was waiting for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The memories of the nightmares fresh, I obediently sat where the white-haired boy had sat, and turned the page. The air rustled with content.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Occasionally I got up to attend to other patrons, but honestly, not that many people visit Adult History. Whenever I delayed in returning to the table where the reader was waiting to me, a scene from the nightmare would come before my eyes- a book crashing towards my face, a corpse falling out of a shelf as I reached up. I ran back as fast as I could, and turned the page.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At 5:30, closing time, I finally got up to leave, stiff, my mouth dry and parched from lack of adequate nutrition. We are not allowed to eat, of course, at the tables. Immediately the growling vibration began. I turned the page three more times, until we reached the end of that chapter. And then he let me leave. It was 5:48.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next day, passed much the same, although I remembered to bring a water bottle and my tablet with me. But he didn&amp;#39;t let me leave until 6:04. I was almost fainting by the time I got home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He is impatient with my snacking, you see. I hastily run outside and grab a bite, between the pages, but he is a fast reader, and I can&amp;#39;t leave the table for long. Otherwise the flying books and falling corpses will appear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the third night, I couldn&amp;#39;t leave until 6:27.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soon I will be here around the clock, turning the pages, sipping water. It is quite nice though, very peaceful after hours. If you crave peace and quiet like I used to, come visit us and say hi. You will see me, an emaciated white-haired librarian, skinnier every day, sitting at the table by myself, with the big book about Russian Empire open before me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is truly fascinating, and I am sure you will love to learn about the Russian Empire. Come visit us. We are here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/1000andonenites&quot;&gt; /u/1000andonenites &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1cdaa/come_visit_us_at_the_local_library/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1cdaa/come_visit_us_at_the_local_library/&quot;&gt;[komentáře]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><id>t3_1c1cdaa</id><link href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c1cdaa/come_visit_us_at_the_local_library/" /><updated>2024-04-11T11:10:02+00:00</updated><published>2024-04-11T11:10:02+00:00</published><title>Come visit us at the local library!</title></entry><entry><author><name>/u/solardrxpp1</name><uri>https://www.reddit.com/user/solardrxpp1</uri></author><category term="nosleep" label="r/nosleep"/><content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summer sun beat down mercilessly as I wiped sweat from my brow. The rhythmic squeak of my sneakers against the asphalt echoed in the still air. Every muscle in my body screamed with exertion, but across the court, my younger brother, Daniel, looked fresh as a daisy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our dad had just finished setting up the new basketball goal, and all day it had been our own personal battleground. We played one-on-one, the score a constant dance between us. But if I’m being completely honest, I was losing most of the time. Daniel, at 17, towered over me by five inches. Every jump shot felt like I was shooting over a tall building. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the sun began to settle, and the mosquitos started to bite our legs, our mother called us into the house. We retread into our house, the familiar creaking of the floorboards greeting our feet like an old friend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I sat down for dinner, the warm smell of Mom&amp;#39;s meatloaf filling the air. But Daniel didn&amp;#39;t join me. He darted straight to the bathroom like a shot rabbit, slamming the door shut behind him with a muffled thud. He was up to something, I could sense it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t just the mischievous glint in his eyes when Mom asked him where he was headed – &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Just gotta use the restroom,&amp;quot; he mumbled, his mouth pressed into a tight line in a desperate attempt to suppress a smirk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He always did that when he was doing something he had no business doing, that forced-down smile that never quite reached his eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I dug into my meatloaf as if I hadn&amp;#39;t seen food in a lifetime. There&amp;#39;s something about playing outside all day that turns your stomach into a bottomless pit. Mom&amp;#39;s smile flickered slightly across the table as she watched me devour my dinner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“How do you like it?” she asked, her voice laced with a hint of amusement I couldn&amp;#39;t quite place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It&amp;#39;s amazing,” I mumbled, my mouth full. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Truth be told, the meatloaf tasted a little off tonight, but I didn’t care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You already know what I&amp;#39;m about to ask,” she continued, her playful tone masking a knowing glint in her eyes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“May 22nd means only one thing, so don&amp;#39;t even try to be slick about it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A cold dread bloomed in my chest. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Report card day…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The weight of my math grade, a giant, crimson “F” blooming on that final report card, threatened to hurdle me in the inevitable, uncomfortable conversation with my mother, a confrontation that I much rather not have. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Mom hadn&amp;#39;t mentioned it earlier, it allowed me one last day to enjoy the summer, because I already knew what failing in the last semester of school meant, summer school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But now, the thought of the conversation gnawed at me. Should I confess? Maybe facing her disappointment now would be better than the constant, churning worry in my stomach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She knew I had the report card so there was no point in trying to lie. I sighed, dropping my fork next to the bits of meatloaf I had left and made my way to my room. As I passed the bathroom to get to my bedroom, a strange, quick sound erupted from inside the bathroom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a yelp, a sound you&amp;#39;d hear a hurt puppy make, but sudden and sharp. The yelp was followed by a horrifying double-whammy of noise: a sharp snap, like a thick stick being broken, and then a deep, heavy thud. It sounded like something large fell, maybe even Daniel himself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sounds froze me in my tracks. My hand hovered near the bathroom door, listening intently. Silence. An unnatural, suffocating silence. Suddenly, my feet started to feel cold. A wet kind of cold. I looked down, and my breath hitched in my throat. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blood. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crimson tendrils of blood snaked out from under the bathroom door, swirling around my feet. Nausea churned in my stomach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instinctively I jumped back from the pool of blood, a primal scream ripping from my throat. The sound echoed through the house, shattering the silence. Moments later, my mother came careening around the corner, with my Dad close behind, who was jolted awake by my scream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One look at the scene, and Mom&amp;#39;s face drained of color. I didn&amp;#39;t need to explain. I just stood there, frozen in a tableau of shock, my gaze glued to the blood seeping from beneath the bathroom door. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dad reached the bathroom door first, his hand instinctively going for the doorknob. It wouldn&amp;#39;t budge. Locked. They both started pounding on the door, their voices raw with panic as they screamed Daniel&amp;#39;s name. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dad shoved my mom aside, with a strong kick, he slammed his foot into the door. The hinges shrieked in protest, and the door caved inwards, swinging open with a deep thud.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was at an angle, unable to see what my parents were seeing, but the raw terror on my parents&amp;#39; faces spoke volumes. Mom crumpled to the floor, sobs wracking her body as she screamed a name that wouldn&amp;#39;t come out. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dad, his face etched with a grief so profound it seemed to age him in seconds. But unlike Mom, he remained standing, his composure a dam holding back a tide of unimaginable anguish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dad walked into the bathroom but instantly came stumbling back out, as if whatever he was seeing, whatever had just happened to Daniel, was physically too much for him to keep looking at. He stumbled out of the bathroom, mumbling and crying incoherently. He choked on his words, the same horrifying question looping over and over from his mouth: “What happened, oh God, what happened?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Driven by a morbid curiosity that warred with my terror, I inched towards the bathroom, grazing my back along the wall, trying to put as much distance between myself and the door as possible. My parents&amp;#39; reaction had planted a seed of dread, a chilling premonition that made me want to just turn around and run. But I just needed to know what it was, what happened to my brother. I peeked inside, and a sight met my eyes that horrified me to my core. But what truly baffled me was how what I was seeing could even be possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My brother&amp;#39;s body was completely limp, sprawled on the ground like a doll. He lay face up... or rather, body up, because his head was torn from his neck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The skin of my brother’s neck, was marred by a jagged line of torn flesh, exposing the deeper layers of dermis and subcutaneous tissue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arterial blood gushed from the open wound, spattering the surrounding area in a macabre display of crimson. The neck bones, once hidden beneath layers of skin, fascia, and muscle, were exposed, their bony surfaces glistening an unnatural white. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cervical vertebrae, a twisted mess, their alignment grotesquely distorted, like a bowl of limp spaghetti. The veins, hang flaccid and lifeless, their lumens empty, their contents spilled onto the ground. The tendons, dangle like frayed strings, their connections to muscle and bone severed, their purpose now rendered useless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I noticed something in Daniel’s hand - a bottle. Swallowing the fear of moving closer, the fear of stepping in my own brother&amp;#39;s blood, I focused my eyes on this bottle , a desperate attempt to block out the horrific scene around me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a total shot in the dark, I felt like this bottle could mean something. ANYTHING that could shed light on what just happened to my brother. I was desperate for answers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ignoring the sharp sting of tears welling up, I grabbed the bottle from his lifeless hand. In that same moment, a bear hug engulfed me, and my dad swept me away from Daniel. He set me down outside the bathroom, the bottle still clutched tightly in my hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I need you to be brave for me, buddy,&amp;quot; my dad said, holding back the emotion in his voice. “We need to call the police right now.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though my vision blurred with tears, I knew from his strained voice that he already knew explaining what happened to Daniel would be really difficult, because none of us knew what happened. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scene outside our house became a blur of flashing lights and shouting voices. A swarm of police officers descended, their movements practiced and urgent. Before I knew it, cold metal clicked around my wrists, the bite of the handcuffs a stark contrast to the growing numbness in my brain. Murder. That was the accusation hanging heavy in the air, a word that felt utterly inadequate to describe the grotesque scene I&amp;#39;d witnessed in the bathroom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was something else entirely, something horrifying and inexplicable. They herded us all into separate squad cars, the silence broken only by the rhythmic whoosh of sirens. At the station, the sterile interrogation room felt like a world away from the chaos at home. Questions came rapid-fire – what happened, did we see anything, did we know anything about the… incident? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My answers were a jumbled mess, a broken record replaying the same horrifying scene over and over. None of us could explain what had happened, only describe the aftermath etched into our very souls. Police had no evidence against us, so we were eventually let go. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The house became a morbid monument, sealed off with yellow police tape. Detectives swarmed the scene, forensics teams followed, their task a grim cleanup of a horror we couldn&amp;#39;t even begin to understand. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We, the displaced remnants of a shattered family, moved at my Aunt Genie&amp;#39;s house. The silence there was suffocating, a stark contrast to the cacophony of emotions within me. My mother retreated into a shell of grief, her voice a silent echo in the halls of her own memory. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My father sought solace at the bottom of a bottle, the amber liquid a poor substitute for the son he&amp;#39;d lost. The world spun on its axis, oblivious to the gaping wound ripped into our lives. We were left to navigate the wreckage, each of us adrift in a sea of our own private hell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I found myself sitting alone in one of the spare bedrooms in my aunt&amp;#39;s house. Sleep was a distant dream, replaced by a churning mix of fear and morbid curiosity. My eyes darted to the small bottle in my hand. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The label on the bottle read &amp;quot;PROJECT NEUROLASH&amp;quot; in bold, black letters. Above it, was an image: an eagle, its talons bound with blue and red ribbons, perched beneath a circle filled with fourteen stars. The logo made me remember something. It had been a while, years even, but I knew exactly where I&amp;#39;d seen the image before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My dad never told us where he worked, his schedule was a chaotic dance of early mornings and late nights. But on the rare occasion I glimpsed him leaving, a glimpse of that very same logo on his work uniform. A cold dread snaked its way through me. The pieces were starting to fall into place, and the picture they painted was terrifying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cool night air slapped me in the face as I stepped outside of my aunts house, the smell of stale cigarette smoke hanging heavy in the air. Dad sat hunched in a rickety lawn chair, the flickering orange glow of the cigarette the only light illuminating his face. It was a face I no longer recognized, etched with lines of worry and a dark despair I&amp;#39;d never seen before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dad?&amp;quot; My voice sounded rusty in the silence. He looked up with a start, his eyes red-rimmed and vacant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Huh?&amp;quot; he grunted, a single syllable that spoke volumes about his state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath, the small bottle in my pocket burning a hole through the fabric. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s something... something I found.&amp;quot; My voice faltered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What is it, son?&amp;quot; He took a long drag from his cigarette, the ember briefly illuminating the haunted look in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It was in the bathroom,&amp;quot; I blurted. &amp;quot;On the floor, next to Daniel.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hesitantly, I pulled out the small bottle, my fingers trembling slightly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He snatched the bottle from my hand, his movements faster than I expected. The lines on his face seemed to deepen, etching a mask of raw terror.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The silence stretched, thick and suffocating. Then, his eyes darted to the image of the logo on the bottle. Recognition dawned on his face, swift and brutal. The blood drained from his skin. It was as if a dam had burst within him, unleashing a torrent of raw terror. In that moment, I saw a truth so horrifying it took my breath away. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without a word, he bolted out of his chair, the metal scraping harshly against the concrete patio floor. His frantic movements echoed the tempest brewing behind his eyes, and a primal fear pulsed in my veins – the fear of a son witnessing the world shatter around his father.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Go inside, Sam,&amp;quot; he rasped, his voice tight with a barely concealed panic. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Everything&amp;#39;s going to be fine. Just... don&amp;#39;t worry about this.&amp;quot; His words rang hollow, a stark contrast to the fear etched on his face. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry about it?&amp;quot; My voice trembled. “How can I not worry? Dad, what&amp;#39;s going on? What happened to Daniel?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He wouldn&amp;#39;t meet my eyes. He simply turned his back on me, the bottle clutched tightly in his hand. His entire body seemed to vibrate with a suppressed energy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I said go inside,&amp;quot; he repeated, his voice a low growl. &amp;quot;This isn&amp;#39;t something you need to be involved in.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as he spoke, I saw it – the flicker of helplessness, the tremor in his hand despite his attempt to appear strong. The bottle clearly held a message far more terrifying than I could even grasp, and my Dad, for reasons unknown, seemed to know something about it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He may have told me not to worry, but there was no way I could obey. The horrifying truth about my brother, and the bottle I found had already begun to unravel the threads of my reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stepping back inside, the house seemed to swallow me whole. The air hung heavy with a suffocating silence. My mom remained in their shared room, a ghost of her former self. Medication now kept her tethered to the bed, a silent prisoner in her own body. The vibrant woman who used to laugh and scold us was gone, replaced by a hollow shell. Her mind, once sharp and witty, was a desolate wasteland. The image of Daniel, forever etched in her vacant eyes, was a constant reminder of the life ripped away from us. It was a picture I couldn&amp;#39;t unsee, a silent scream echoing in the emptiness that was my mother.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exhaustion finally claimed me. I stumbled to my own spare room and collapsed onto the bed, the tears I&amp;#39;d been holding back for so long erupting in a torrent. Hours melted into one another as I grieved, the raw ache in my chest an unwelcome companion. A hot shower helped wash away the grime, but couldn&amp;#39;t cleanse the image of Daniel&amp;#39;s body from my mind. It replayed on a loop, a horrifying scene I wished I could erase. Yet, another image haunted me – the logo on the bottle, a stark reminder of my dad&amp;#39;s work uniform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sleep came eventually, a heavy thing dragging me under. But it was short-lived. I jolted awake, heart hammering in my chest. A dark silhouette stood in the room, my dad. The dim light softened his features, but sleep still clung to my vision. He leaned closer, his touch a feather-light kiss on my forehead. &amp;quot;I love you,&amp;quot; he whispered, his voice thick with a hidden emotion. &amp;quot;Look after your mother.&amp;quot; It was a plea, a burden he placed upon me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, he was gone. A faint creak echoed through the house – the front door of my aunt&amp;#39;s place, opening and closing with a soft thud. Had I imagined it all? The lingering warmth on my forehead told me otherwise. My father had been here, and the weight of his unspoken truth settled heavily on my shoulders. He was gone, leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions and a chilling certainty – the logo, the bottle, his absence – they were all pieces of a puzzle far more sinister than I could have ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That was six months ago. My father hasn&amp;#39;t come back since. A few months after my dad left my aunt&amp;#39;s house, my mother and I were finally permitted to return to our home. When the authorities deemed it safe for us to return, the bloodstain was the first thing I noticed upon stepping back into the bathroom. It was a small, unyielding circle, a constant, silent reminder of the brother I had lost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, though, I found something. In my dad&amp;#39;s office, hidden beneath a jumble of clothes, was a laptop. I&amp;#39;d been searching the house for answers, and I think I just found them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My fingers trembled as I navigated the dusty labyrinth of the laptop&amp;#39;s files. Then, a single folder jolted me. No label, just a stark black icon that sent a shiver down my spine. With a bated breath, I clicked it open.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A torrent of cryptic files spilled onto the screen, each name a whispered secret. One in particular snagged my attention: &amp;quot;Project_Neurolash.&amp;quot; My mind raced back to the image of the bottle, the chilling logo etched into its surface. Curiosity, laced with a prickle of dread, propelled me forward. I double-clicked the file, and a wave of documents, images, and data flooded the screen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a rabbit hole, a digital vault overflowing with classified information. Research logs, internal memos, and chillingly detailed reports – all centered around a single, horrifying project: &amp;quot;Neurolash.&amp;quot; Panic clawed at my throat as I saw my father&amp;#39;s name woven throughout the files. He wasn&amp;#39;t just a researcher; he was deep in the heart of this clandestine operation, a key player in the development of a potent, government-sanctioned bioweapon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The documents explained that &amp;quot;Neurolash&amp;quot;: a weaponized toxin designed to orchestrate a symphony of suffering within its victim. Uncontrollable muscle spasms, wracking the body, causing the neck and head to spin uncontrollably until the vertebrae tears, resulting in self-decapitation. Paralysis, or worse, awaited those that got exposed to this pathogen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reports detailed the potential for contamination, the ways this pathogen could infiltrate the body. But the most chilling section focused on the mechanism of action. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neurolash targeted the central nervous system, disrupting the dance of nerve signals. It’s primary targets were the neck and spinal muscles, a strike designed to leave its victim a broken marionette, forever frozen in a grotesque tableau of pain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I then came across an email exchanged between my father and an anonymous colleague. It was a message from my father to his colleague, expressing his desperate decision to protect his family:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Subject: URGENT - NEUROTOXIN MISSING&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dear Ryan,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“My hands shake as I type this. The weight of my decision sits heavy on my chest, but my conscience is clear. The recent security breach at the lab made it horrifyingly clear – Neurolash cannot be contained. We&amp;#39;re playing with fire, and I fear the flames are about to engulf us all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done something drastic. I&amp;#39;ve taken a small sample of the neurotoxin. Don&amp;#39;t try to retrieve it. I’ve hidden it somewhere, but I won’t leave it there for long, just until I can find a better place to hide it. I know you must think I’m betraying you, but my family… their safety is my number one priority. Neurolash in the wrong hands is a nightmare beyond comprehension.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t about abandoning the mission. Consider it a desperate gamble. A chance to buy time, to find a way to dismantle this weaponized nightmare at its core. To expose the truth before it&amp;#39;s too late. Please, Ryan, if you receive this, understand. You have a family too. Trust me. This is the only way to keep them safe. For now, silence is our only weapon. I&amp;#39;ll find a way to contact you again, but for now, our families come first.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely, John”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The realization pressed down on me. The bathroom, the twisted remains of my brother, the chilling bottle with its cryptic logo – all of it clicked into place. Project Neurolash. This government-sanctioned nightmare was the twisted answer, weaving through the tapestry of my brother’s tragedy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My father, his disappearance wasn&amp;#39;t random. It was the consequence of his actions, a desperate bid to shield us from the fallout of his own guilt. The email spoke of “unimaginable consequences,&amp;quot; and a terrifying picture emerged. My father, a man burdened by a secret so heavy it shattered him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Slamming the laptop shut, a single question echoed in the silence: would my father ever come back home? Maybe someday, but a certainty settled in my gut. How could he? I mean, how could any man come back home after making such a horrible and stupid mistake? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The poorly hidden bottle, the neurotoxin it contained – it was all my father&amp;#39;s doing. He&amp;#39;d brought this danger into our home, and it had taken Daniel from us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The image of my dad in my room that night at my aunts house, as he told me to take care of my mother, his tear-filled eyes, his trembling hands – it wasn&amp;#39;t just fear I saw then, it was guilt. The guilt of a man who failed to protect his family, who brought a deadly secret under our roof and hid it poorly, leading to the death of his own son, the death of my brother.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My father hadn&amp;#39;t vanished on a mission or run from punishment. He couldn&amp;#39;t bear to face the consequences of his actions, the weight of his son&amp;#39;s death hanging heavy on his conscience. He left, consumed by guilt, a self-imposed exile for the unforgivable mistake that tore our family apart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/solardrxpp1&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;growing up, me (maria), lilah and erin all lived in a small, friendly (or so we thought) town in the middle of the uk called stone. our weekends would always, since we were younger, consist of going to the local shop and getting whatever we needed for the weekend. none of us would ever admit this, but we always go to that exact shop to see our favourite security guard who we’ll call benny. he was a very well known man in the town, always known to have a smile on his face and a pep in his step. he was a tall, well built man, in his late fifties and looked quite good for his age. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;one day, following our usual weekend routine, we entered the shop and to our surprise the familiar man we knew and loved was no longer there. he was replaced. the man stood in his place, was a slender looking, bald man with overly dark eyes that just didn’t sit right with us. his name tag reading “peter”. as we were all quite sociable people, we went over to the unfamiliar face and asked where benny had gone just thinking maybe he was ill or something had come up. his response was dry and cold, “he’s gone.” we all paused and shared a look with eachother. what does that mean? it didn’t seem right for benny to just leave without an explanation considering we spoke to him weekly and he loved his job and wasn’t old enough to retire, at least not just yet. we asked the security guard what he meant by this and he just stared at us blankly with those dark eyes as if we weren’t even there. we continued with our day as usual not really overthinking it much. as we left the shop, we felt his cool gaze following us. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;the following weekend, we went to the shop as usual hoping to see benny back in his usual place. but our hope came crashing down to see peter stood in bennys spot. by this time, we’d heard people talking about benny. word had got around that he’d just disappeared or maybe something worse had happened. we assumed this just to be gossip so we questioned peter further. we went over to him, his cold eyes never leaving sight of us. “have you heard anything about benny, we’ve heard he’s disappeared?” erin asked. as soon as these words left erins mouth, the colour drained out of his face like he’d seen a ghost. lilah asked him “what’s wrong?” he insisted, “nothing nothing, i’m just worried about him.” however, his tone didn’t sound sincere. we didn’t want to pry to much, so we left it at that and went back to my house. this happened on saturday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;the next day, we went back to the shop because we were starving. we weren’t going to question peter again following his reaction last time. this shop visit was purely just for food. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;as we walked through the aisles, lilah said she saw peter lurking round the corner staring at right at us. to begin with, me and erin thought she was just bullshitting and trying to scare us as we already found this man’s appearance quite off-putting. then i noticed it to his long skinny fingers clinging on the end of the aisle his head poking round the corner. those menacing eyes never leaving us. i looked over at erin. she had already seen it peeking too. as soon as he noticed we all caught sight of him, his head slowly retreated back round the corner. after this had happened, we all decided it was best to leave and to make do with the little food at home. as we hurried out of the shop, we turned around to see him back in his usual spot. we continued home feeling wary of our surroundings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;when we got back to my house we made do with the small pizza in the freezer and turned on the tv to take our minds off our strange encounter with peter. flicking through the channels, bennys face flashed up on the screen. it was the news. we had to listen to what was being said. the reporter was stood in a field surrounded by yellow caution tape. immediately we all had a bad feeling as if we knew what was about to be said. “a mangled body was recently discovered by locals on the outskirts of stone in the river trent. authorities have come to investigate the scene to see if there is any traces of a potential murderer or murder weapon. there are suspicions that it could be the well know security guard benny rogers following his recent disappearance. the coroners are yet to identify and we are hoping to find out within the next few days. our thoughts are with the families that this could be affecting.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;it was monday now and a new update on the recent murder had come out. they had finally identified the unknown victim. the same news reporter from the previous update was on the tv. “tragically, the coroner has identified that the body found was benny rogers. police are now working to find out who was responsible for the death and murder of the much loved and cared for benny. we’ve tried reaching out to family to support them as much as possible but right now what’s best for them is time to mourn this horrible fate that has fallen upon them.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;after hearing this heartbreaking news, we all decided to go back to where it all started. the shop. we entered the shop as we usually did. but something or someone was missing, it was peter. he was gone. we wanted to know where he had gone or why he’d left, even though we all knew why deep down. the worker stated that he had hurriedly decided to resign with no explanation as to why. we thought that was odd as he only just got the job. but we all had a sense of relief as we all found him pretty disturbing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;as he wasn’t there for us to confront him, we all decided to go back erin’s as it was after school and that was what we usually did. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;when we got to erin’s we thought everything would be over and that would be the end of that. alls we wanted to from now was to forget about peter and mourn over our beloved benny. but suddenly, we felt that same feeling like the other day in the shop. like we were being watched by someone or something. we tried to ignore it but the feeling stuck. we looked out of the window to see if we were just being paranoid. but there he was. peter. stood behind the tall tree that stoop opposite the house, those long fingers curving around the tree. his head just peering around the side. those menacing eyes. but this time they were different. they were darker much darker. as if something more sinister was lurking behind them. we were terrified and went into the bathroom and locked the door behind us. we all tried to call our parents. messages aren’t sending either. the signal in the town is gone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;we heard the front door open. erin’s parents aren’t supposed to be home from work now (they work away for multiple days at a time) we know it’s him. we hear his heavy breathing almost sounds like he’s laughing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;as i write this, we are still locked in the bathroom. we’re scared and don’t know what to do but i needed to share this story with everyone before it’s too late. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;im hoping i can come back as soon as possible to give an update on this whole fucked up situation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;if anyone’s local security guard goes missing around the uk and a new one with the same description as peter takes their place, do not interact with him. he’s dangerous. we don’t know what he’s capable of right now. &lt;/p&gt;
